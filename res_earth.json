There are gaps in financing for developing countries <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and bringing adaptation projects to the stage where they bring real protection against climate impacts such as droughts, floods and sea-level rise.<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/high-ambition-coalition\/\" target=\"_blank\">High Ambition Coalition: Preparing for Climate Refugees<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the pace of adaptation financing is rising, it is being exceeded by rapidly increasing adaptation costs. Annual adaptation costs in developing countries could reach $500 billion by 2050. However, adaptation financing is currently far short of what experts say is needed, at $30 billion per year- far too little to ward off the risks posed by climate change. Fewer than five out of 100 adaptation projects have yielded any benefits to date, according to a survey of 1 700 projects. Andersen says, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We need a global commitment to put half of all global climate finance towards adaptation in the next year. This will allow a huge step up in adaptation \u2014 in everything from early warning systems to resilient water resources to nature-based solutions.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experts at the press briefing agreed that because developed countries are responsible for a majority of the historical carbon emissions, they should play a bigger role in mitigating the climate crisis. They also said that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">adaptation measures should include installing climate information and early-warning systems, safeguarding people in affected areas and green investments.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report urges for more nature-based solutions- locally appropriate actions that address societal challenges, such as climate change, and provide human well-being and biodiversity benefits by protecting, sustainably managing and restoring natural or modified ecosystems- financed through public and private finance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unep.org\/news-and-stories\/press-release\/step-climate-change-adaptation-or-face-serious-human-and-economic\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Global Commission on Adaptation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has estimated that investing in adaptation initiatives could yield returns that are three times the costs. Further, Henry Neufeldt, head of impact assessment and adaptation at UNEP, says, \u201cthe more we mitigate, the less we have to adapt, and the costs of adaptation are going to be much, much lower.\u201d However, unlike the emissions reduction targets that are part of the Paris Agreement, there are no comparable targets for adaptation. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly how much adaptation finance is needed because the goals are not clear, the targets are not clear, there is no agreed-upon goal on adaptation at national and global levels,\u201d <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2021\/01\/there-is-no-vaccine-for-climate-change-u-n-environment-chief-says\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neufeldt said<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report says that achieving the 2\u00b0C target of the Paris Agreement could limit losses in annual growth to up to 1.6%, compared to 2.2% for the 3\u00b0C trajectory.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report concludes by saying that all nations must pursue the efforts outlined in UNEP\u2019s Emissions Gap Report 2020, which called for a green pandemic recovery and updated NDCs that include new net-zero commitments. However, the world must also plan for, finance and implement climate change adaptation to be prepared to support those nations least responsible for climate change but most at risk. Doing so is a sound economic decision.<\/span><\/p><p><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/ciat\/5243802649\/in\/photolist-8ZnRQv-8ZnRBg-8ZqVPo-mWApx2-2ix9XVy-hiqBTG-mWAshF-mWCpx9-mWAk3a-mWAKjr-mWADKR-mWAyTZ-mWAmVP-mWAuKZ-mWCvSy-mWAM6c-8HDHH1-fTMrVL-mWCHQG-nRAniJ-nzeWcU-nys4z2-apFsVD-mWAFwg-ecQPWy-mWAoAK-apxno1-mWAqmD-2hk7b3a-9y4evX-9y7cvW-9y4ejB-apGd5M-GVfA3A-25wLorR-hDLWC4-hDNqCi-iSqAT6-2ixcxAP-apL1F1-8ZqWBN-apHiDz-BebCin-dCBssB-P4c8aF-hDLYvH-apL1Hq-BCV9Tb-GDrEqL-P4c5AH\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr\u00a0<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/the-world-is-not-prepared-for-climate-change\/"},"Page 3":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">5 Ways That 2020 Was Good For Climate Change<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Jan 8th 2021<\/span><span>6 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"5 Ways That 2020 Was Good For Climate Change\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/30020825413_4005e1d8ed_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"5 Ways That 2020 Was Good For Climate Change\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/30020825413_4005e1d8ed_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>2020 was without a doubt a profoundly difficult year.

However, how this is being regulated is unknown.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, many landmark international meetings on climate change were meant to be held in 2020, but many of these were cancelled or postponed.

However, many energy companies with net-zero pledges are still expanding the fossil fuel side of their business, and many tech companies with net-zero are still helping these energy companies find and extract more fossil fuels.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, it is still encouraging that companies are not finally starting to publicly share the emissions tied to their supply chains and the products they produce, called \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/grist.org\/energy\/big-oil-is-finally-talking-about-the-elephant-in-the-room-the-emissions-footprint-of-its-products\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scope 3 emissions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d This added level of transparency puts more pressure on companies to reduce their carbon footprint.<\/span><\/p><ul><li><strong>Renewable Energy Continued to Grow<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the pandemic ground the global economy to a halt, fossil fuel companies suffered immensely when oil prices crashed, while the renewable energy sector was far more resilient. Clear skies allowed for solar panels to capture more energy, where in the UK, improved solar power efficiency helped it run on zero coal-fired power plant generation for more than two months for the first time in over 100 years. Meanwhile, in the US, electricity generated by renewables outpaced electricity generated by coal for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/grist.org\/beacon\/coronavirus-gives-renewables-a-boost\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40 days straight<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a November report by the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/iea.org\/reports\/renewables-2020\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International Energy Agency (IEA)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that global renewable energy electricity installation will hit record levels in 2020 compared to the sharp declines in the fossil fuel sectors caused by COVID-19, accounting for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/renewable-energy-hits-record-growth-in-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">90% of new power capacity worldwide<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, renewable energy is getting cheaper.

He has promised to listen to scientific experts and rejoin the Paris Agreement in the first 100 days of his presidency. While he certainly has his work cut out for him and will have to put significant and speedy work into getting the US back on track to achieve its climate ambitions, it is nevertheless a step in the right direction.

Fossil fuels companies around the world found it more difficult to get projects financed, as seen when the Trump administration announced it would open Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development and not a single major bank said it would finance operations in the biodiverse area. Financial institutions were also pressured to account for their role in driving deforestation, fires and biodiversity loss from Borneo to the Amazon.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January, BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, announced that it would put sustainability at the heart of its investment decisions and prestigious schools like Oxford and Cambridge joined a growing list of colleges and universities planning to divest their endowments from fossil fuel companies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is clear that investments in fossil fuels are not as viable as they once were; Exxon, which hasn\u2019t made any commitments to reduce its emissions, was booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the first time in its 92-year history.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is clear from 2020 that the world is moving towards a greener future, and it is hoped that 2021 is the year that momentum for action against climate change continues at a faster pace.

This has raised concerns regarding energy supply, exhaustion of primary energy sources and the environmental impact of greenhouse gas emissions. The ideal solution to this problem would be to transition to low-carbon technologies to minimise the reliance on primary energy resources. Adoption of renewable energy technology would also help offset the degradation caused by greenhouse gas emissions and pave the way for policy transition to low-carbon technology.

This could also be one of the reasons why the increase in fossil fuel investment tends to exceed that of RE investments. One of the solutions to address this problem is to adopt<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1364032116302349?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> microfinancing or micro-lending strategies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to achieve large-scale funding through small investments.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, these projects are generally steam-rolled by governments. Government-run projects in developing countries lack the efficiency and competitiveness of private corporations; consequently, these projects suffer from bureaucratic bulwarks, political corruption, delays in accessing institutional finance and several other institutional hurdles.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For instance, in a bid to battle climate change, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/transfin.in\/what-are-the-problems-faced-by-the-solar-energy-industry-in-india\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">India<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> aimed to increase solar production to 100 000 MW by 2022.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> However, new tax laws introduced by the government greatly demotivates investors and developers from pursuing this goal. The new tax laws increased the tax obligation of energy firms which accounted for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/transfin.in\/what-are-the-problems-faced-by-the-solar-energy-industry-in-india\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1.1 billion <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of indirect tax. While the government pledged to ensure that these taxes would be reimbursed to companies pursuing renewable energy projects, delays have resulted in only partial reimbursements.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to these administrative and institutional bulwarks, projects may never reach completion or may cause businesses to suffer from severe losses. Policy advocates propose that developing countries must abandon the strategy of government-run projects.

This raises concerns since the nuclear energy industry often discredits renewables in its lobbying. Since Brazil is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/energytransition.org\/2018\/11\/brazilian-energy\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sixth largest GHG emitter<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the world, Bolsonaro\u2019s neoclassical policies can adversely affect investment and investor\u2019s confidence in investing in clean energy projects.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, political conditions such as corruption, bureaucracy, government transitions and administrative effectiveness will affect investor\u2019s confidence in the regime and the prospects of clean energy projects.<\/span><\/p><p><b>The Hidden Cost Problem<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hidden cost problem can greatly impact an investor\u2019s willingness to invest in both clean energy and carbon-based projects in developing countries.

Additionally, while several developing countries have abundant manpower, there is a paucity of literate and technically trained manpower. Training and equipping employees with the skills needed to work on clean energy projects further increases costs. These increasing costs can discourage investors and can create a perception that the country hosts an inadequate support level for renewable energy projects. This is ironic because the transition to green energy makes more economic sense for developing countries especially due to the anticipated rise in energy demand.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, even if investors are willing to increase the amount of investment, these infrastructural inadequacies continue to hamper efficient production of clean energy since these facilities are not yet consolidated. Despite the hidden cost problem, investors could be incentivised to finance clean energy projects in developing countries through government subsidies, tax benefits and improved access to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1364032116302349?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">institutional finance.<\/span><\/a><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, an energy transition in developing countries is a challenging task but it is not unattainable.

Established in 2014, on October 23 every year, we celebrate this endangered cat and raise awareness for its conservation and protection. While there are many countries and communities committed to protecting this fascinating creature, the snow leopard population is under threat due to shrinking habitats, a declining number of prey and poaching. A large part of conservation efforts is to raise awareness through education. So here are some facts about the elusive, stunning snow leopard.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snow leopards are often found in the mountains of Central Asia and have adapted to a cold and dry climate.<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snow leopards are around 55-65 centimeters in height and 90-115 centimeters in length.

The mother tends to raise her offspring alone, providing food and shelter for her cubs. The cubs follow their mothers for the first 18-22 months of their lives, learning how to hunt before becoming independent.\u00a0<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snow leopards are important to their ecosystem because as top predators, they maintain the ecological balance by preying on mountain sheep and goats, preventing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wwf.org.uk\/learn\/wildlife\/snow-leopards\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increases in herbivore populations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and changes to the vegetation.<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people who live near snow leopard populations <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wwf.org.uk\/learn\/wildlife\/snow-leopards\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rely on resources<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provided by these landscapes, such as wood for shelter, heat and fuel.

Snow leopards sometimes prey on livestock that leads to retaliatory killings.

For example, the OECD suggests that carbon taxes are not harsh enough on coal production, although it has proved to be effective for the electricity industry. A carbon tax has been effectively implemented in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.imf.org\/2019\/10\/10\/fiscal-policies-to-curb-climate-change\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweden<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; the carbon tax is USD $127 per tonne and has reduced emissions by 25% since 1995, while its economy has expanded 75% in the same time period.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, organisations such as the United Nations are not fit to deal with the climate crisis: it was assembled to prevent another world war and is not fit for purpose. Anyway, members of the UN are not mandated to comply with any suggestions or recommendations made by the organisation. For example, the Paris Agreement, an agreement within the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, says that countries need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly so that global temperature rise is below 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, and ideally under 1.5 degrees. But signing on to it is voluntary, and there are no real repercussions for non-compliance. Further, the issue of equity remains a contentious issue whereby developing countries are allowed to emit more in order to develop to the point where they can develop technologies to emit less, and it allows some countries, such as China, to exploit this.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Food Waste<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A third of the food intended for human consumption- around 1.3 billion tons- is wasted or lost.

The report attributes this biodiversity loss to a variety of factors, but mainly land-use change, particularly the conversion of habitats, like forests, grasslands and mangroves, into agricultural systems. Animals such as pangolins, sharks and seahorses are significantly affected by the illegal wildlife trade, and pangolins are critically endangered because of it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More broadly, a recent analysis has found that the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/sixth-mass-extinction-of-wildlife-accelerating\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sixth mass extinction<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of wildlife on Earth is accelerating.

From DNA testing, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0234358\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there is no existing match of known algae<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, hence it is considered a new type of seaweed in the genus Chondria.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the US <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov\/executive-order-13112-section-1-definitions\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Invasive Species Information Center<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the new seaweed is not considered invasive, as it is unknown whether it was introduced to the native islands by humans or if it originated from there in very small numbers and only recently exploded. Normally, marine invasive species are introduced into new areas via human activities, through fish being accidentally transported on ships, for example.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers have instead characterised the seaweed as a \u2018nuisance species\u2019 due to the sudden ecological impact caused by its expansive and explosive growth. There is conclusive evidence of their abilities to destroy coral reefs; according to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0234358\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">published article<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the seaweed was found to outgrow native reef species and replace keystone species, fundamentally, changing the ecological structure of reefs. This has caused irreversible damage to coral reefs in Hawaii because the seaweed is outcompeting the corals for light and nutrients, causing a collapse in the ecosystem.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/norway-whaling-catch-hits-four-year-high\/\" target=\"_blank\">481 and Counting: Norway\u2019s Whaling Catch Hits Four-Year High<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The researchers are also concerned at the seaweed\u2019s tendency to break off into tumbleweed-like structures and travel far distances, posing risks for nearby coral reef ecosystems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example where an invasive species has decimated the native ecosystem is that of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/oceanservice.noaa.gov\/facts\/lionfish-facts.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lionfish<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Originating from the South Pacific and Indian Ocean, the lionfish has invaded the Atlantic ocean, with frequent sightings along the southeastern coast of the US and the Bermuda Islands. The Lionfish hunts and outcompetes native fish for food, causing an imbalanced food chain.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In areas where the seaweed had taken over, Heather Spalding, one of the researchers and an algae specialist from the University of Hawaii says that \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/deb3a60394ea79b52702d0b4d191a463\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">everything was dead underneath<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d The large mats of seaweed essentially block light that corals need to live, making it difficult for these and other marine life to flourish. Known species of fish that graze on algae do not touch the new seaweed, and such areas are void of marine life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determining the causes of a systemic change in the ecosystem is rather difficult but one important factor favouring seaweed growth is increasing ocean temperatures. Opportunistic seaweed can adapt to fluctuating warmer waters and completely <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/repository.usp.ac.fj\/10314\/1\/Charan_et_al_2017_ICEECC.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">overtake coral-dominated systems<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. An example of this is in the Gulf of Maine where there used to be an abundance of kelp beds but these are currently being overtaken by turf seaweed. Growth of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ecs2.2923\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kelp beds favour lower temperatures<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and they provide large areas of cover for the native fish. Without this cover, native fish are being predated on by migratory fish species.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seasonal changes can contribute to seaweed blooms throughout the year, but with over 20 years of NOAA observations and surveys in the area, the researchers have concluded that it is not an ordinary seaweed seasonal growth, but rather a symptom of an existing problem, such as increasing water temperature from climate change.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To combat this nuisance seaweed and save coral reefs in Hawaii and beyond, it is vital to find out the origins and causes of growth, both of which are still unknown at this stage.

Furthermore, excess nitrogen fertiliser cannot be taken up by the soil and runs off into bodies of water causing eutrophication and hypoxia. Eutrophication refers to the over-enrichment of water with nutrients that leads to massive algal blooms, blocking out sunlight and depleting the dissolved oxygen. This leads to low oxygen levels known as hypoxia, resulting in mass die-offs or migration of species from the affected area creating an oceanic desert.

No-till often includes planting perennial plants that retain their roots for more than one growing season. Perennials have<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2071-1050\/12\/5\/2071\/htm\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stronger and deeper roots than annual crops<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, reducing soil compaction and improving aeration. These roots also provide a steady supply of soil nutrients in the form of liquid exudates to support a healthy community of microbes and macro-organisms. No-till is often combined with cover cropping to protect against erosion and improve soil health. The cover crop\u2019s roots bind the soil in place and offer physical protection from wind and water erosion, while adding plant diversity in monoculture cropland. Some cover crops also create habitats for natural pollinators, whose presence <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-019-50811-y\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increases crop yield and shortens the growing season<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The most popular types of cover crops are<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cropnutrition.com\/resource-library\/cover-crops-type-makes-a-difference\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grasses and legumes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that scavenge nitrogen and carbon from the soil as well as sequester it from the atmosphere, add fertile humus to the soil as they break down, and provide weed control.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Biocontrol<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biological pest control and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/ingredients-used-pesticide-products\/what-are-biopesticides\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">biopesticides<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are two natural alternatives to conventional biocides that can also be used in conjunction with cover crops. In natural systems, pests rarely cause problems because the complex web of predator-prey interactions, competition and genetic diversity keeps the ecosystem in balance. Recreating these relationships through either the introduction or augmentation of existing predator or parasite populations is a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/landscapeipm.tamu.edu\/types-of-pest-control\/biological-2\/types\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">form of biocontrol<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that protects crops while reducing the need for synthetic pesticides. Another technique, known as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0958166913007210\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPush-Pull\u201d<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, involves planting repellent plants between crop rows to discourage pest colonisation, while establishing \u201cpull\u201d plants that are more attractive to the pest than the crop around the perimeter of the field. This draws pests away from the centre of the field and towards margins where predator populations are more strongly established. As a natural alternative to pesticides, biopesticides work in a multitude of ways, some imitating biochemical signals, while others introduce fungal, viral or bacterial diseases that infect the pest.<\/span><\/p><p><b>Natural fertilisers<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green manure, or mulch, is dead plant matter that is spread over a field and left to decompose. Legumes, such as vetch and clover, make especially great manure as they <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-981-13-0253-4_12\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">store carbon and nitrogen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in their roots as they grow, creating high quality natural fertiliser. Unlike conventional nitrogen fertilisers that saturate the soil to achieve maximal yield, green manure releases nitrogen into the soil gradually thus preventing run-off, with major beneficial consequences for water quality. Green manure often comes from cover crops that are planted in the field and then either cut or left to wilt in place. They provide ground cover while alive, and return nutrients upon decomposition, mimicking naturally-evolved ecosystems.<\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like in nature, the effects of individual sustainable practices overlap and integrate with each other to forge a cohesive whole. The tools and strategies for building healthy agricultural systems able to feed over 8 billion humans while preserving the environment already exist; it is simply a case of rediscovering what past agriculturalists and indigenous peoples already knew: that nature will provide on condition we work with it, not against it, and that we give back as much as we take. Moreover, investing in the study of ecosystem interactions will lead to healthier, more productive soils and a decreased reliance on toxic fertilisers and biocides. This will have overwhelmingly positive consequences for global food security, nutrition and health, as well as for the reduction of environmental damage and pollution.<\/span><\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/human-activity-land-surface-changes\/"},"Page 20":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/energy\">Energy<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">India Plans to Build 40 New Coalfields on Ancient Forest Land<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/carol-konyn\/\">Carol Konyn<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <\/span><span>Aug 13th 2020<\/span><span>5 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"India Plans to Build 40 New Coalfields on Ancient Forest Land\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1099924007_9b885c4b7a_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"India Plans to Build 40 New Coalfields on Ancient Forest Land\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1099924007_9b885c4b7a_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>A rich and biodiverse Indian forest called Hasdeo Arand, home to indigenous communities, ancient trees, elephants and sloths, is under threat by the coal mining industry.

Moreover, future research should aim to build on the investigation of Moln\u00e1r and colleagues to help further identify global-warming-induced projections, what is causing such projections and how they can be managed or mitigated.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/polar-bears-to-become-extinct-by-2100\/"},"Page 23":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/pollution\">Pollution<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">This Year\u2019s Arctic Wildfires Have Set A Pollution Record<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Jul 16th 2020<\/span><span>4 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"This Year\u2019s Arctic Wildfires Have Set A Pollution Record\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/8490150475_a5d78952b4_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"This Year\u2019s Arctic Wildfires Have Set A Pollution Record\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/8490150475_a5d78952b4_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>A prolonged heatwave in the Arctic that caused temperatures to soar to <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/siberia-experiences-heatwave-with-temperatures-10%E2%84%83-above-average\/\" target=\"_blank\">38\u2103 in parts of Siberia<\/a>, is causing wildfires to rage through parts of Siberia, Alaska, Greenland and Canada.

Temperatures at the Amundsen-Scott research station in Antarctica rose by 1.8 degrees Celsius between 1989 and 2019; by comparison, global temperatures rose 0.5 to 0.6 degrees Celsius during the same period. This warming of the South Pole, one of the coldest and most isolated places on Earth, shows that it is starting to feel the impacts of the climate crisis.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41558-020-0815-z\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>P<\/strong>ublished in the journal Nature Climate Change<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, researchers at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand analysed 60 years of weather station data and used computer modeling to determine the cause of the accelerated warming. They determined that warming at the South Pole happened at a rate of 0.61 degrees Celsius per decade, and was caused by warm ocean temperatures in the western tropical Pacific Ocean and anthropogenic warming driven by greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These warmer ocean temperatures had lowered atmospheric pressure over the Weddell Sea in the southern Atlantic over the decades, which increased the flow of warm air directly over the South Pole.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, the Antarctic plateau had been cooling while global temperatures were rising, but the researchers found that this is no longer the case.

The IPO cycle typically lasts for roughly 15-30 years and alternates between a \u2018positive\u2019 state- where the tropical Pacific is hotter and the northern Pacific is cooler than average- and a \u2018negative\u2019 state where the opposite occurs. The IPO flipped to a negative cycle at the beginning of the century, leading to a flow of warmer air right over the South Pole.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/the-climate-crisis-affects-the-global-carbon-cycle\/\" target=\"_blank\">How The Climate Crisis is Affecting the Global Carbon Cycle<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While temperatures at the South Pole still generally range from -50 to -20 degrees Celsius, the study shows that even the coldest and most isolated parts of Antarctica are starting to feel the impacts of the climate crisis. The study illustrates how complex the Antarctic climate is and how it is influenced by climate cycles in completely different regions of the world. Climate change in the region is difficult to determine as different regions of the continent often experience different climate trends at the same time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, while the South Pole was cooling in previous decades, West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula was melting; now that the South Pole is heating up, warming on the peninsula has declined.

Nevertheless, it is still vital to decrease greenhouse gas emissions as Antarctica\u2019s seaside glaciers are rapidly melting from the bottom up as warm ocean water seeps beneath the ice, which could have disastrous impacts on rising sea levels globally.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/south-pole-is-warming-three-times-faster-than-the-global-rate\/"},"Page 26":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/oceans\">Oceans<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Climate Change Makes Some Fish Smaller, and Others Bigger, Study Finds<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/mongabay\/\">Mongabay<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <\/span><span>Jun 23rd 2020<\/span><span>4 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Climate Change Makes Some Fish Smaller, and Others Bigger, Study Finds\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-06-23T090752.055.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Climate Change Makes Some Fish Smaller, and Others Bigger, Study Finds\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-06-23T090752.055.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>Climate change is doing something unusual to the fish in our oceans: As water temperatures rise, this causes fish to morph in size.

Second, they examined how fish species living in one location would be affected by climate change-induced warming over time.<\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/hong-kong-shark-finning-trade\/\" target=\"_blank\">Hong Kong\u2019s Distressing Role in the Global Shark Finning Trade<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p> <img alt=\"climate change fish size\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-16149 size-full\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Screenshot-2020-04-29-at-9.35.08-PM.png\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Screenshot-2020-04-29-at-9.35.08-PM.png 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Screenshot-2020-04-29-at-9.35.08-PM-300x216.png 300w\" height=\"554\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20554'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"768\"><noscript><img alt=\"climate change fish size\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-16149 size-full\" height=\"554\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Screenshot-2020-04-29-at-9.35.08-PM.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Screenshot-2020-04-29-at-9.35.08-PM.png 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Screenshot-2020-04-29-at-9.35.08-PM-300x216.png 300w\" width=\"768\"\/><\/noscript><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><figcaption><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An infographic showing differences in fish size throughout a species\u2019 distribution.

Moreover, it was the bigger fish that tended to get bigger, and the smaller fish that usually got smaller.<\/p><p>\u201cOne of the reasons this study is important is that it shows the complexity of species\u2019 responses to warming in our oceans,\u201d Nicholas Payne, assistant professor in zoology at Trinity College Dublin\u2019s School of Natural Sciences and co-author of the study, said in a statement. \u201cMuch of our understanding of the temperature-size relationship comes from the laboratory; taking our predictions to the wild shows us there is a lot we still need to learn about this hugely important phenomenon.\u201d<\/p><p>The implications for these size changes are not fully understood, but these fluctuations would certainly have an impact on the marine food web, Audzijonyte said.<\/p><p>\u201cAs fish get smaller, they\u2019re more vulnerable to predation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means that they will have a higher mortality from predators. All of these sized-based interactions will be changing quite a lot, and we don\u2019t know what that means.

study\u2019s co-authors and an assistant professor of forest, conservation and recreation policy at the University of Maine, stressed that the study was \u201cnot saying that this is a perfect cure all, because if you\u2019re killing all incentives to have biomass removed \u2026 you actually get more forest loss.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s not perfect, but you\u2019re at least retaining some forest as forest that might not otherwise be there,\u201d he added.<\/p><p>Daigneault said it\u2019s important to note that increased demand for biomass would not reduce logging; \u201cIt will go up,\u201d he said. However, in the long run, the adjustment of prices for timber for biomass could mean that \u201cthe land is worth more as trees than something else.\u201d<\/p><p>A statement from the University of Maine that accompanied the release of the report said the researchers used a global timber model to assess and compare bioenergy demands and timber harvesting in more than 200 forests in 16 different regions.<\/p><p>\u201cWhile policy approaches vary on the regional level, their modelling analysis of the forest carbon rental payment approach indicates that forest area will increase substantially across the globe, with medium price scenarios leading to 500 million to 700 million new hectares of forests,\u201d the statement said.<\/p><p>Asked if the billion-hectare projection was reasonable, Daigneault said it was achievable because \u201cthe model assumes that you have proper institutions \u2026 and proper knowledge\u201d of forest management.<\/p><p>He pointed to South America as one region where he has anecdotally observed an increase in monoculture tree plantations, and said that, globally, the number of new tree plantations has \u201cdoubled\u201d over the past 30 years.<\/p><p>\u201cIncentivizing both wood-based bioenergy and forest sequestration could increase carbon sequestration and conserve natural forests simultaneously,\u201d the researchers said in the abstract of the report. \u201cWe conclude that the expanded use of wood for bioenergy will result in net carbon benefits, but an efficient policy also needs to regulate forest carbon sequestration.\u201d<\/p><p>The report does say, however, that while higher timber prices can incentivize afforestation, they also \u201cencourage harvesting of natural forest areas.\u201d In addition, the model only projects an increase in total carbon sequestration when the demand for woody biomass exceeds 1.1 billion cubic meters per year by the year 2100.<\/p><p>Mary Booth, an ecosystem scientist and the director of the nonprofit Partnership for Policy Integrity, described the study as a \u201cdisaster\u201d that is being spun \u201cas a positive story.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cEvery one of their scenarios shows a massive loss in natural forest area relative to the baseline,\u201d Booth said in reference to the report\u2019s\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/advances.sciencemag.org\/content\/6\/13\/eaay6792\/tab-figures-data\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">graph projections<\/a>. \u201cThey are projecting up to 250-million hectare loss in natural forests; whereas natural forests are the best defence against climate change.

Scientists call these \u2018drunken forests\u2019. The ground here consists of permafrost \u2014 soil, sediment, rock and ice that often remains at or below 0 degrees Celsius year-round. Permafrost covers approximately 22.8 million square kilometres in the Arctic, sub-Arctic and alpine regions \u2014 comprising nearly a quarter of the exposed land surface in the northern hemisphere.<\/b><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>I<\/strong>n Alaska, 85% of the state lies within the permafrost zone, though discontinuous permafrost \u2014 areas with patchy permafrost presence \u2014 underlies much of the <a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.climatehotmap.org\/global-warming-locations\/fairbanks-ak-usa.html\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fairbanks area.<\/a> In Arctic regions, permafrost temperatures often dip down to -8 degrees C. But in Fairbanks, which lies roughly 321 kilometres south of the Arctic Circle, temperatures hover much closer to the freezing point, causing the permafrost to sporadically thaw out. This freeze-thaw action has long posed challenges for natural and human systems, intoxicating forests, breaking pavement, sinking houses, and even sometimes draining lakes sitting atop it.<\/p><p>But as climate change heats up the planet, with the Arctic warming at twice the rate of the rest of the globe, things are about to get a whole lot worse.<\/p><p><strong>Why is permafrost melting bad?<\/strong><\/p><p>Scientists began seriously worrying about climate change impacts on permafrost about 15 years ago, but not only because of degraded infrastructure. The world\u2019s permafrost serves as a massive carbon reservoir, storing nearly twice the amount of carbon currently found in the atmosphere. An estimated 1 400 gigatons of carbon \u2014 made up of decomposed plants and animals which once inhabited the Earth \u2014 can be found embedded in permafrost.<\/p><p>By comparison, our atmosphere presently contains just 850 gigatons of carbon. As the planet warms and permafrost thaws, some of that locked-up carbon will be released into the atmosphere.

If we intend to limit warming to 2 degrees C, as stipulated in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, we\u2019ll need to cut emissions even sooner than IPCC models currently predict to account for the carbon released by thawing permafrost.<\/p><p>Until recently, scientists assumed global permafrost wouldn\u2019t lose more than 10% of its carbon, and that this would occur over a drawn-out timescale. But when they pooled observations from more than 100 Arctic field sites in the Permafrost Carbon Network, they found that the permafrost likely released an average of 1.662 trillion kilograms (1.832 billion tons)\u00a0 of carbon each winter from 2003 to 2017 \u2014 double that of past estimates. On Alaska\u2019s North Slope, permafrost temperatures have increased by 11 degrees F in just 30 years.

This can shock the surrounding landscape into releasing even more carbon than if it had thawed at a leisurely pace.<\/p><p>In a paper published in February in\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41561-019-0526-0\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Nature Geoscience<\/em><\/a>, Turetsky and her co-authors found that, while abrupt thaw will likely occur in less than 20% of the world\u2019s permafrost zone, it could affect half of all permafrost carbon through rapid erosion, collapsing ground and landslides. Despite influencing only a small portion of the Arctic, abrupt thaw emissions could have the same climate feedback effect as gradual thaw emissions would over the entire permafrost zone.<\/p><p>These abrupt releases could trigger a positive feedback loop whereby the permafrost\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions would further warm the atmosphere, which would then thaw more permafrost and release more carbon. Turetsky says that without accounting for abrupt thaws, we\u2019re underestimating the impact of permafrost carbon releases by 50 percent.<\/p><p><strong>The Methane Conundrum<\/strong><\/p><p>\u201cThe climate consequences are as high as gradual thaw because abrupt thaw is releasing a lot more of its carbon as methane,\u201d Turetsky explains.<\/p><p>Though permafrost serves as a carbon sink, when that carbon is released into the atmosphere it can come out as either carbon dioxide (C0<sub>2<\/sub>) or methane (CH<sub>4<\/sub>), depending on whether the carbon stores were subject to aerobic or anaerobic respiration. The danger here: methane is far more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2<\/sub>, trapping up to 30 times more atmospheric solar radiation.<\/p><p>\u201cIf you look at just the magnitude of carbon, abrupt thaw only releases about 40 percent of the carbon relative to gradual thaw. But that carbon comes out as a lot of methane and it has bigger climate consequences,\u201d Turetsky says.<\/p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s both worrisome and reassuring at the exact time,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhat we now know is that abrupt thaw doesn\u2019t affect a huge area of the Arctic\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the good news \u2014 \u201cbut it does carry a punch.

Given the potential for decomposition of large stocks of organic soil carbon, such changes could be an important factor in the future,\u201d the authors write.<\/p><p>Over the next decade, researchers will be trying to model the potential methane releases from Arctic permafrost more precisely \u2014 those estimates will help policymakers determine just how short a time we have in which to act before our climate crisis morphs into a climate catastrophe.<\/p><p>The news isn\u2019t all bleak:\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/367\/6480\/907\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">another study<\/a>\u00a0published in\u00a0<em>Science Advances<\/em> in February used paleoclimate research to argue that though permafrost does have the potential to emit large quantities of methane, it\u2019s \u201cunlikely the gas released from those stores will reach the atmosphere.\u201d Using ice cores from Antarctica, scientists examined air composition dating back 8 000 to 15 000 years, Earth\u2019s last major deglaciation period.

However, recent statistics from the Environmental Protection Department have indicated that the average daily disposal quantity of plastic bags in 2017 rose to 793 metric tons, just short of the 867 ton level recorded in 2008, a year before the levy scheme was introduced.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, a recent survey showed that in supermarket chains, around 90% of vegetables and fruit are packaged in plastic, sometimes using multiple materials. This packaging problem has been made all the worse by the rise in popularity of online shopping.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2018, Hong Kongers sent an average of 1.53kgs per person of solid waste to landfills every day. The city sent a total of 5.87 million tonnes of solid waste to local landfills in 2018. Just 30% of solid waste was recycled in the city in 2018, which is made all the more concerning due to the fact that recycling facilities in the city are very basic, sorted by hand.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are continuous calls from environmentalists and consumers alike that the government should adopt tougher and more pro-active measures to regulate the use of plastic packaging. Additionally, recycling facilities in the city need to be bolstered.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2017, it was estimated that Hong Kong threw away <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/hong-kong\/health-environment\/article\/2116318\/hong-kong-throws-away-52-million-bottles-every\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.2 million bottles every day<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to Patrick Yeung Chung-wing, a project manager for ocean conservation at WWF Hong Kong, about 80% of the city\u2019s marine litter is plastic, especially disposable products such as plastic bottles, plastic bags and packaging material.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, Singapore is battling to combat waste that is sent to landfills, however, it is making positive steps through public education.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, the Republic sent almost <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/singapore\/environment\/3-million-tonnes-of-waste-discarded-in-singapore-last-year\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three million tonnes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of trash to its only landfill on Semakau Island- almost 30% of that was plastic waste, followed by food waste at 20%, and paper and cardboard waste at 19%.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there was a 6% reduction in the total amount of waste generated last year compared with 2018, overall recycling rates to 59% from 61% in 2018, which could have been influenced by China\u2019s ban on foreign plastic waste ; the Republic\u2019s National Environment Agency (NEA) says that 34% of Singapore\u2019s recyclables are exported, so \u2018the status of the external market and policy of other countries towards recyclables would have a significant impact on our recycling rate\u2019.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, the government outlined its first <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.towardszerowaste.sg\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zero Waste Masterplan <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to reduce the amount of waste sent to its landfill by 30% by 2030, put in place to extend the landfill\u2019s lifespan beyond the projected 2035.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these cities in Asia are no doubt making efforts to tackle and reduce the plastic waste crisis plaguing them, it is essential that these policies and efforts are correctly regulated to avoid them making no significant gains or even collapsing.

Some experts believe that drought played a role in sparking Syria\u2019s civil war.

In the case of the climate crisis, many developing countries do not have the resources or technology to adapt or mitigate the impact of it, which leads to rebellion and social unrest. Further, when these climate refugees move to other countries (usually developed Western countries), clashes in ideology can also lead to extremism.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many leaders gearing towards extremism, like Osama bin Laden, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/yaleglobal.yale.edu\/content\/climate-change-expands-terrorist-threat\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">included environmental issues<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in his propaganda to recruit supporters. The group used the West\u2019s failure to act against the climate crisis through the exploitation of natural resources in developing countries as a way to recruit people. However, some militant groups also finance their activities through oil extraction, illegal logging and mining, and other environmentally destructive activities, exacerbating the climate crisis and further destabilising developing economies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This unending cycle has caused many people to be displaced and forced to migrate elsewhere. Host countries often view these migrants as economic migrants or asylum seekers, however if it was considered that the ultimate root cause of these migrations was climate change, perhaps the conversation around the issue would be different, one that prioritises getting to the root of the problem instead of the end result.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines two types of climate refugees: ones that are created through sudden and temporary environmental changes, such as hurricanes and floods. However, more often than not, those that are affected will return to their homes. The other type of climate refugee is the pressured environmental migrant, that is created through the long-term gradual change in environment such as droughts, desertification and sea level rise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Positively, there are some countries that foresee the impacts of the climate crisis and are acting to mitigate its effects.

The majority of the land of the island is below 2 meters above sea level which, in addition to increased frequency of storms, has contaminated the atoll\u2019s groundwater. The country has determined that it will be cheaper to relocate than to protect the island against sea level rise. A similar relocation strategy has been considered by the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2009\/oct\/11\/mohamed-nasheed-maldives-rising-seas\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldivian government<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who pledged in 2009 to become the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nations that will be most affected by the crisis would be remiss not to have the same considerations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The climate crisis also highlights inequality, called the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/what-is-the-climate-caste-system\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">climate caste system<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, whereby poor people and nations suffer the most from the climate crisis while wealthier people and nations suffer less, while emitting the most carbon.

The 2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/new-un-report-warns-climate-change-could-trigger-global-food-crisis\/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>report on land-use<\/b><\/a><b> suggests that the key to reducing agricultural emissions is through changing current land use, mainly by reducing fertilisation and by planting a variety of native crops that are suitable for that environment.\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p><b>\u2014<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>T<\/strong>he re-adoption of native crops to improve agro-biodiversity is another way to bring about a sustainable change in food production. In most developing countries, several indigenous crops were, and are still being, abandoned or their cultivation threatened by the adoption of high-yielding varieties as part of so-called \u2018green revolutions\u2019 powered by large-scale industrial agriculture, often involving multinational corporations. These corporations are generally unconcerned with their high carbon footprint and soil is saturated with chemicals which damages the crops and the soil itself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, there have been numerous movements in countries like India, Mexico and Malawi by a consortium of farmers, environmentalists, scientists and other stake-holders to revive the fading agro-biodiversity and move towards sustainable agricultural methods.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Save Our Rice<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Save Our Rice campaign, launched in 2004 in India, is one such movement that aims for sustainability and self-sufficiency in rice production by reviving and popularising native rice varieties that were abandoned in the decades following India\u2019s \u2018green revolution\u2019 in the 1970s.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Panavally, a village in the Southern Indian state of Kerala, is the Rice Diversity Block (RDB), made of around 300 indigenous varieties of rice, maintained by the green NGO, Thanal\u2019s agro-ecology centre. Most of these were collected from individual farmers who had conserved the seeds that they had traditionally cultivated. \u201cWe produce more seeds for our seed banks from RDBs. Interested farmers can visit our centre, see the paddy varieties in all their glory and get the seeds from us for their own sustainable cultivation of native varieties,\u201d says Ushakumari S., the executive director of Thanal and the national coordinator of the Save Our Rice (SOR) campaign.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign was launched as a statement against the introduction of Golden Rice- the genetically modified high-yielding rice aimed to reduce Vitamin A deficiency. Initially focused on training farmers, it has developed into a full-fledged seed conservation and sustainability movement, spread across several states, linking seed conservators to farmers and farmers to consumers. Usha, a trained horticulturist, says, \u201cIndia used to be home to more than 100 000 native varieties of paddy and Kerala alone cultivated more than 3 000 landraces. They are not only more nutritious than white rice, but they offer more medical benefits in some cases. Today less than 4 000 varieties are being raised by farmers in the entire country. That is a serious loss of diversity and something that needs to be reclaimed, especially in the current context of the food security threat we are facing from the climate crisis.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><b>Resisting the Climate Crisis<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SOR participants first noticed the resilience of indigenous rice during the early years of the last decade when rice-growing regions in South India were struck by untimely dry spells. \u201cIt is something that has become evident to us in the last few years when we had severe variations in temperature and rainfall here in Wayanad. Native varieties weathered the storms while the conventionally-cultivated hybrid paddies suffered,\u201d says Rajesh Krishnan, a former Greenpeace campaigner who is now a farmer of an indigenous paddy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHybrids, or what we call \u2018semi-dwarf\u2019 paddies, were developed for fertiliser and pesticide-aided agriculture for higher yields. They performed well during the early years. But then overuse of chemicals began to maximise the yield. This is counter-productive as it makes the plant more succulent, thus attracting various pests, not all of which can be effectively controlled using pesticides. Higher levels of fertiliser and pesticide use can also severely impact organic matter in the soil, which is necessary for nitrification,\u201d says Dr. Leena Kumari, former head of Kerala Agricultural University\u2019s Rice Research Stations. However, most native varieties, she adds, are resistant to local pests as well as adverse local climatic conditions. In that regard, indigenous crops have a clear advantage over the hybrids.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, since these landraces are grown without the usage of synthetic fertilisers on a relatively smaller scale without any machinery, the greenhouse gas emissions are far less than conventional industrial agriculture. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For rice cultivation, going native means reduction in pesticide use since native paddies are naturally resistant to pests. This reduction is a major achievement considering rice ranks higher than any other crop in pesticide use.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going native also sustains local economies. \u201cThere is an attempt to sell the produce to the local community itself rather than try to export it to faraway places. It is similar to the 100-mile movement in the US where people try to buy food that has been produced within their own locality. Such a focus to produce as well as sell locally helps cut transportation- a major factor in agricultural carbon emissions,\u201d adds Usha.<\/span><\/p><p><b>Support and Yield<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Farming of indigenous crops using traditional organic methods is widely acknowledged by mainstream agro-researchers to be more eco-friendly than industrial agriculture. However, it has yet to receive significant institutional support. Dr. Leena says, \u201cThis is the biggest challenge that farmers transitioning into cultivating native paddies face. There needs to be a proper system for procuring produce at a fair price and processing it. There used to be several small mills for processing local varieties. Today most of the big mills are geared for processing hybrid grains and mill owners won\u2019t buy native breeds.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This could be overcome by farmers organising themselves like in Wayanad, where 10 farmers who cultivate landraces have formed a company, the Thirunelly Agri Producers Company, to procure and process the grain at a decent minimum price.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there is the question of yield. The popular argument is that landrace crops cultivated organically yield less produce than hybrids. \u201cThis is a myth from what we see here in Wayanad. We have noticed that careful simultaneous cultivation of various native breeds through traditional methods provides consistently better yields than conventional mono-culture of hybrids,\u201d says Rajesh. Farmers from across India side with Rajesh\u2019s observation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Leena strikes a cautious tone when it comes to yields. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough studies that confirm the high yields of landraces, so I can\u2019t say for sure if we can completely replace hybrids with native paddies. The key is to adopt the right method along with the right variety depending upon the local climate and pest and soil type.\u201d However in many regions, native breeds suitable for the local setting, can no longer be found.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Similar Movements<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story of SOR is not an isolated one.

Many of the negative and most severe impacts of climate change are manifested through <a href=\"https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/313\/5790\/1068\" target=\"_blank\">changes to the water cycle<\/a>. Climate change will severely alter the quantity, quality and spatial distribution of global water resources. Consequent increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme events like droughts and floods will have significant implications for water scarcity and human well-being. However, the conception of water is often local in scale (for example, local irrigation) and the policy response to water-related challenges are often based on standalone strategies and short-term repair and remediation (for example, repairing flood levees). Water needs to be collaboratively managed on a global level to ensure that the best responses to these challenges are implemented.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><b><i>Global Water Challenges<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>M<\/strong>easures to adapt to climate change and past international climate summits have so far failed to adequately consider the link between water and climate change.

Adopting a water-centric adaptation approach can simultaneously align climate adaptation with water management and mainstream the practice of integrative water management in the broader climate adaptation agenda. Introducing the new background paper, Dr John Matthews, executive director of AGWA, injected some hope for the future by suggesting that water is a \u2018menace with hope\u2019 and is the best tool to coherently organise our national and global climate solutions. Flexible, co-management regimes in collaborative water governance, the inclusion of water resources in bottom-up multi-sectoral risk assessments and the need to fully consider water resources in the finance, investment and insurance industry were among the recommendations given in the background paper for effective climate change adaptation.<\/span><\/p> <img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-13838 size-full\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/water-info.png\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/water-info.png 1600w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/water-info-300x178.png 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/water-info-768x455.png 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/water-info-1024x606.png 1024w\" height=\"947\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201600%20947'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"1600\"><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-13838 size-full\" height=\"947\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/water-info.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/water-info.png 1600w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/water-info-300x178.png 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/water-info-768x455.png 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/water-info-1024x606.png 1024w\" width=\"1600\"\/><\/noscript><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><figcaption><em><b>Figure 1<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Climate adaptation solutions framed around adequate water management and fully considers the role of water in climate resilience (Source: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/alliance4water.org\/gca-water-background-paper\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith et al. 2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><p><b><i>Crisis into Opportunities<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Netherlands, widely regarded as having the best protected deltaic region in the world, is a worthy case to consult in the mission of fostering a culture that thrives by living with water rather than acting against it.

Ovink cited The Netherlands\u2019 groundbreaking <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ruimtevoorderivier.nl\/english\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Room for the River Programme<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an example of successful water-centric resilience and capacity building. The major nationwide programme, completed in 2019, is aimed at increasing flood resilience by enhancing floodplain capacity through interventions such as deepening river channels, reclaiming floodplains, creating artificial hills and constructing dykes. The programme adopted a multi-sectoral systemic approach where alongside improving flood protection, project interventions also build community resilience and address social and economic concerns of local residents. Outcomes of the programme included urban river parks for recreational use, foot- and cycle-paths along newly created river dykes and areas reclaimed for the development of sustainable housing. Water-centric projects such as this emphasise the potential to leverage human ingenuity and use design, innovation and creativity to strengthen both institutional capacity and climate resilience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Climate change will lead to significant shifts in the <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/are-we-running-out-of-water\/\" target=\"_blank\">water cycle<\/a> and the frequency of extreme floods and droughts will increase. However, as the background paper and all the panelists at the COP25 launch event suggested, the story of water in the future under climate change need not be one of devastation and destruction. For climate adaptation to make economic sense in the long run, it has to be done effectively. For climate adaptation to be effective, it must consider water management in all future strategies and appreciate water resources as the integrative resource that it is.<\/span><\/p><p><b><i>A version of this article was originally published on copcas.uk as part of the Walker Institute\u2019s COP Climate Action Studio (COPCAS) Programme at the University of Reading, UK.<\/i><\/b><\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/reconsidering-the-role-of-water-in-climate-resilience\/"},"Page 39":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/policy-and-economics\">Policy &amp; Economics<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">History of Human Expansion: What This Has Meant for Extinction of Species<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/carla-delgado\/\">Carla Delgado<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <\/span><span>Jan 10th 2020<\/span><span>4 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"History of Human Expansion: What This Has Meant for Extinction of Species\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Webp.net-resizeimage-19-1-1024x683.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"History of Human Expansion: What This Has Meant for Extinction of Species\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Webp.net-resizeimage-19-1-1024x683.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><b>According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the expansion of human population and consumption has increased species extinction by <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biologicaldiversity.org\/news\/press_releases\/2014\/extinction-rate-05-29-2014.html\" target=\"_blank\"><b>more than 1,000 times<\/b><\/a><b> the natural rate.\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p><b>\u2014<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>T<\/strong>his is a conservative estimate because of the large numbers of species still unknown to science, and there are uncertainties in predicting future extinctions given increased habitat destruction and the spread of <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/invasive-species-worlds-ecosystems-facing-a-fresh-threat\/\" target=\"_blank\">invasive species<\/a> and diseases.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The findings of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.un.org\/sustainabledevelopment\/blog\/2019\/05\/nature-decline-unprecedented-report\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> revealed that the extinction rate could have been 20% higher were it not for active conservation efforts.<\/span><\/p><p><strong>The Effects of Human Expansion<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hu<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">man expansion<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has always <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/pnas\/108\/15\/6044.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">affected the environment<\/a>\u2013 animals have been hunted and domesticated and plants used and eaten since the beginning of humanity.

Much of western African countries, Ethiopia, and parts of Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo are the hardest-hit regions, standing to lose more than 40% of their flora. The species both at risk and potential risk include trees, shrubs, herbs and woody vines.<\/span><\/p><p><strong>Biodiversity Loss in Africa<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loss of biodiversity will be particularly problematic in tropical Africa, \u201ca region of incredible diversity but with major social and political challenges and expected rapid population growth over the next decades,\u201d said lead researcher Dr Thomas Couvreur, a botanist at The French National Institute for Sustainable Development.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The situation could get worse. As well as the species that are at risk of extinction, a further 33.2% of the species studied are rare and could potentially be threatened with extinction. Major threats to biodiversity, especially in areas of exceptional plant diversity, primarily in the tropics, are often linked to industrial-scale activities such as timber exploitation or large plantations, mining and agriculture.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research projects such as these are vital; while almost 90% of mammals and two-thirds of birds have been assessed, less than 8% of plants have been assessed, a surprising find considering how crucial plants are to the Earth\u2019s ecosystems. This lack of data is especially true for tropical regions, such as the ones found in Africa, where the flora is extremely diverse, but have been poorly documented.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biodiversity going extinct has a knock-on effect. For example, some of the plant species that the African forest elephant eat can only germinate by passing through the animal\u2019s digestive tract. Without these tree species, the elephants cannot eat and without the elephants, the tree species cannot reproduce, further emphasising the need to preserve these ecosystems.<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/chinstrap-penguin-numbers-fall-as-temperatures-rise-in-the-antarctic\/\" target=\"_blank\">Chinstrap Penguin Numbers Fall As Temperatures Rise In The Antarctic<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p> <img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-13463 size-full\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Webp.net-resizeimage-4-1.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Webp.net-resizeimage-4-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Webp.net-resizeimage-4-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Webp.net-resizeimage-4-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" height=\"683\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20683'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"1024\"><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-13463 size-full\" height=\"683\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Webp.net-resizeimage-4-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Webp.net-resizeimage-4-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Webp.net-resizeimage-4-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Webp.net-resizeimage-4-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" width=\"1024\"\/><\/noscript><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><figcaption><em>Commiphora<\/em> is listed as endangered in four regions of Africa, including Ethiopia.

Dr Covreur says that \u201cthis study is the first large-scale assessment of the potential conservation status of the tropical African flora, explicitly using the IUCN\u2019s methodology. While the results of the study are concerning, it is important that more studies such as these are conducted, so that threats facing biodiversity can be ascertained and managed.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbd.int\/convention\/articles\/?a=cbd-14\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Article 14<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity explicitly states that environmental impact assessments (EIAs) should be conducted before implementing projects that could impact on biodiversity in an area.

We moved to Hong Kong 8 years ago and one of the things that we love about the city is how multifaceted it is- it\u2019s very densely populated, but a few minutes out, you can experience some incredible nature. There are very few places in the world like it. We\u2019ve been entertaining a sport called coasteering- essentially the coastal equivalent of mountaineering.<\/p><p>My wife and I sat down and wondered if it was possible to climb the whole island in one loop. The idea was that we would walk, climb and swim along the coast until we came back to where we started. One thing that we quickly realised as we scouted out the coastline was how polluted it is, especially along stretches that are not open to the public. We thought that we could do more than just have fun; we could make this into a bigger project. We partnered with Hong Kong-based NGO Ocean Recovery Alliance and used their Global Alert app to record and map the trash that we came across; as well as the Open University of Hong Kong, to take water samples to study the pollution levels.<\/p><p>We recorded the journey in 2017 and then produced and bootstrapped it for 2 years, where we thought many times that the project would never be completed and that if there wasn\u2019t a larger meaning behind it, we would\u2019ve aborted it.<\/p><p><strong>I should also add for the audience that Paul is an entrepreneur; he and his wife have launched many initiatives around Hong Kong. How do you choose your causes or subjects of interest and what process do you go through when choosing your next adventure?<\/strong><\/p><p>I worked in the corporate world where my daily routine was dictated to me. When I left, I decided that I wanted to do things that I\u2019m passionate about. \u00a0I started off doing a lot of these mountain adventures which were just for me. I took a step back and wondered, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m able to have these adventures but have a bigger impact besides financial benefit?\u201d This started with a project I did in India, where I drove a tuktuk through the country. I was invited to a presentation by an Indian NGO that works to get girls access to education and I wasn\u2019t aware of how big this problem was.\u00a0 I thought we could combine this cause with the adventure, thus the Education Explorers initiative was born. We drove the tuktuk through India for 3 weeks and wherever we stopped (mostly involuntarily) we would visit schools, NGOs or government entities to show them evidence of the problem. This drive to have impactful adventures has launched past, and hopefully future endeavours.<\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/event-our-planet\/\" target=\"_blank\">Oceans: Our Blue Challenge With Stan Shea\u00a0<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p> <img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-13382 size-full\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/DSC08434.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/DSC08434.jpg 6000w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/DSC08434-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/DSC08434-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/DSC08434-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" height=\"4000\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%206000%204000'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"6000\"><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-13382 size-full\" height=\"4000\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/DSC08434.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/DSC08434.jpg 6000w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/DSC08434-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/DSC08434-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/DSC08434-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" width=\"6000\"\/><\/noscript><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><figcaption><em>Paul Niel (left) being interviewed by Earth.Org cofounder, Marco Pellerey<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Could you give us more insight into the link between adventure and impact investments?<\/strong><\/p><p>As an investor, you need to think of your goals and how best to maximise your return.

I sometimes catch myself using single-use items and thinking that it\u2019s not a big deal, however it\u2019s a small piece of a much larger picture. Secondly, Hong Kong doesn\u2019t place value in trash. There\u2019s no reason why in a city where most of its trash ends up in landfills, that the government shouldn\u2019t be billing us for our trash. Solutions are needed at a policy level; this journey has made me realise just how much waste we needlessly produce.<\/p><p>We can be a part of the solution in small ways, like refilling our bottles instead of just throwing them away.<\/p><p><strong>We have seen how much rubbish is frequently left on Everest and how the mountaineering industry in general is a big polluter. Can you comment on extreme sports and pollution?<\/strong><\/p><p>There is a new measure in Nepal where groups have to pay a deposit as a guarantee that they\u2019ll bring all their trash back with them. If you fly out of Antarctica, there are some private operators that now demand that you take everything back with you. There is a problem, and there are some countries implementing policies to mitigate the environmental impact that sports can have.<\/p><p>The places that will suffer the most are those that have received an increasing number of tourists over the last decade and do not have any policies in place to mitigate environmental damage, such as Cambodia.<\/p><p><strong>What\u2019s next for you?<\/strong><\/p><p>I have become more focused on merging my interest in technology with exploration. Over a year ago, I went on an expedition with a group to Mongolia to search for dinosaur fossils using drones fitted with imaging cameras to map the discovery sites. I have been using this technology to find other interesting things in Hong Kong, such as underwater ship wrecks.<\/p><p>I have discovered that the same technology we can use to map wrecks can also be used to find historic remnants of oyster reefs around Hong Kong, which were plentiful until they were dug out and destroyed.

Changing the carbon balance so there is a higher level of inputs than carbon losses leads to a N.E.T phenomenon. To achieve this, practices that increase inputs or reduce losses must be implemented.

Simultaneously we grow vegetables and other crops too,\u201d says another farmer Kalia Mambalaka, 40. \u201cWhile we pluck our vegetables almost daily, we harvest paddy and millets over a period of five months \u2014 between October and February next year.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Farmers say that crop diversity, which ensures optimal use of natural resources, is very effective against soil erosion and land degradation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><strong>The resilient farms<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main crops cultivated by the Kondhs, like pearl millet and sorghum, are climate-smart and ideal for environments prone to drought and extreme heat. Traditional upland paddy varieties, which are harvested 60 to 90 days after sowing, consume less water making them resilient to drought-like conditions. These staple food crops are less likely to fail even in extreme heat.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crops can also survive intense and untimely rainfall because of the cultivation pattern the farmers follow on their Dongors. \u201cRainwater cannot damage the crops because the thick shrubby black gram and groundnut plants remarkably slow down the speed of the water flowing down the hills,\u201d explains Gani Kumbaruka, 40, a farmer from Rayagada district.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kondhs do not use harmful pesticides. Instead, they let at least ten species of pests, insects, ants, flies, earthworms, spiders, birds and other pollinators to thrive on their lands. They call these species \u2018dus parivar\u2019 (ten families).\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey allow pests and insects, and birds to visit Dongors freely,\u201d says Debjeet Sarangi Managing Trustee at Living Farms \u2014 a non-profit promoting traditional and sustainable agriculture by indigenous communities. \u201cThis natural ecosystem works so well that they don\u2019t need to use any kind of chemical fertilisers or pesticides.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>An ideal model<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new climate report from the United Nations<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/new-un-report-warns-climate-change-could-trigger-global-food-crisis\/\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has warned that the world might face a food crisis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to climate change and overexploitation of land and water resources.

Howard<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shockingly, while the mergers mentioned above received the most media attention and public resistance, Howard\u2019s latest report found that 2018 brought 56 other acquisitions and joint ventures involving other top seed companies, including Limagrain\u2019s Vilmorin-Mikado subsidiary in France and Longping High-Tech in China, which acquired Dow\u2019s maize division in Brazil. Both ChemChina and Longping High-Tech are planning more acquisitions of seed companies in China.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Professor Howard\u2019s analysis, two years after genetically engineered (GE) varieties were introduced in 1996, by 1998 the large agribusiness companies had started buying up smaller firms to accumulate more intellectual property (IP) rights. By 2008, Monsanto\u2019s patented genetics alone were planted on 80% of US corn acres, 86% of cotton acres, and 92% of soybean acres. Today, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ers.usda.gov\/data-products\/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">these percentages<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are even higher.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these mergers have economic ramifications, they have social ones, too. Because of the gene and crop patents that these seed companies own, farmers are often unable to save seeds for the next season, which allows the companies to increase prices, which results in a higher percentage of farmer profits going to seed purchases than before and lowers profit margins per acre for farmers. This puts upward pressure on farm size, which often contributes to simplified farming practices that lead to environmental harm.<\/span><\/p><p><b>The Need for Crop Diversity<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Climate change is threatening crop production, and studies show that it may already be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/333\/6042\/616\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reducing the productivity <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of some major crops, including wheat. Climate change is also increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, like floods, as well as increased pest invasions, which not only harms the crops, but also crop pollinators.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A key element of resilience against climate change is crop genetic diversity; however, when large industrial agriculture companies exert their influence, diversity is generally reduced, which means fewer types of crops. With increased mergers and acquisitions, this will likely get worse.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A study of crops yields in various levels of diverse conditions shows that yields were on average 7% and 22% higher for corn and soybeans respectively, that were grown in more diverse crop rotations under hot and dry conditions. Greater drought tolerance has also been observed <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Jean-Paul_Chavas\/publication\/227346891_On_Crop_Biodiversity_Risk_Exposure_and_Food_Security_in_the_Highlands_of_Ethiopia\/links\/0912f507db39c50452000000.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with increased varieties of a single crop in Ethiopia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Large seed companies divert their attention to a small number of major crops, like corn, soybeans and cotton. This is a problem because many of the crops that have been replaced by corn and soybeans, like sorghum, millet, pigeon peas and cassava, are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/civileats.com\/2015\/09\/28\/is-millet-the-next-super-grain\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more climate resilient.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Further, within the crops they favour, there is poor genetic diversity, because it is more expensive and time-consuming to produce many diverse locally adapted varieties.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, these seed company mergers could lead to a reduction in research. Brett Bergemann, Monsanto\u2019s COO, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-17\/monsanto-says-it-s-evaluating-another-takeover-bid-for-syngenta\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201cThe crop chemicals industry is bound to consolidate because target companies are spending too much on research and development for new products.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An industry has lost its competitive character when the concentration ratio of the top four firms is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/civileats.com\/2019\/01\/11\/the-sobering-details-behind-the-latest-seed-monopoly-chart\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40% or higher.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The seed industry continues to exceed this, not only across the entire global supply, but across crop types as well. For example, even before the Big 4 merged, three firms (Monsanto, Syngenta, and Vilmorin) controlled 60% of the global vegetable seed market.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, studies suggest that increased market domination removes companies\u2019 incentive to innovate. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ers.usda.gov\/amber-waves\/2004\/february\/have-seed-industry-changes-affected-research-effort\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US Department of Agriculture\u2019s<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> data confirms this, saying that fewer players mean less innovation. According to the report, as the seed industry became smaller, private research \u201cdropped or slowed\u201d and those companies that survived consolidation are \u201csponsoring less research relative to the size of their individual markets than when more companies were involved.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><b>What Can We Do?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small-scale and indigenous farmers have developed, nurtured, conserved and traded diverse local crop varieties for thousands of years and are essentially the stewards of the genetic diversity we need to continue to adapt to a changing climate. Unfortunately, large seed companies will continue to displace or absorb small and peasant farms, so it is vital that we support these small-scale farmers at all costs.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, antitrust law enforcement and oversight in the US needs to be strengthened so as not to allow a handful of firms to amass the enormous market, economic and political power over the global seed supply that is being shown now. A lack of oversight means that it is up to the public to demand action and resist companies that put the sustainability and security of our food and farming future at risk. We must also demand and support more investment in public plant breeding programs that are responsive to the needs of regional and resilient farming systems that support the health of both people and the planet.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeds represent profound potential for improving our food and agricultural systems. Plants can be bred to thrive without pesticides and to naturally resist disease, and to be adaptable to changing climates and environmental conditions; they can also be bred to improve the quality of our food. But to realise this, we must create structural changes to how seed is managed and shared.<\/span><\/p><p><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/47730240@N05\/6025170068\/in\/photolist-abqz9y-8M2ETp-8M5HU9-566u-28ExX2i-3Vp2i-abnZ5X-9BfHoa-UzEpQ-g19PM-abqz9s-oVf4g-6hoA-dLsfdd-2hzXPXp-oAec8b-4KCBSh-2j3cVV-5iTMUW-kMeHL-8PbzG1-8bTR-dB92wY-9H3wzh-3NQ42-85TnZ7-2AzxRS-2dFG7FW-46qBkD-tqSDMJ-vqU9k-Vcfj2r-48j47K-ESKxY-43rAo-GL9Xxi-75Y1rR-9he2Wb-zZ6n87-f7gd4P-FmxX-4eLHgE-aqnPX2-2jmfWzZ-2krVBQm-5Rcjci-24bevka-89Ys4z-adXfuL-cbdApm\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr\u00a0<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/dangers-of-seed-company-mergers-in-a-warming-world\/"},"Page 2":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">High Ambition Coalition: Preparing for Climate Refugees<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/tristan-bove\/\">Tristan Bove<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <\/span><span>Jan 19th 2021<\/span><span>13 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"High Ambition Coalition: Preparing for Climate Refugees\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/2095961797_1d27dedc4e_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"High Ambition Coalition: Preparing for Climate Refugees\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/2095961797_1d27dedc4e_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><b>The Paris Agreement outlines a framework to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. The 1.5\u00b0C goal, among other ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement, were championed by the High Ambition Coalition, an unofficial accord between signatories of the Paris Agreement to pursue more ambitious climate targets. The coalition was formed by Tony de Brum, Foreign Minister of the Marshall Islands, in the months preceding the 2015 Paris negotiations. Current temperature rise projections illustrate what the future may soon hold for developing countries such as the Marshall Islands. The story of the coalition\u2019s formation may inform the global community may respond to climate change-induced migrations, arguably the most severe consequence of the climate crisis.<\/b><\/p><p>\u2014<\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Marshall Islands and the High Ambition Coalition were of critical importance to developing the Paris Agreement\u2019s more ambitious targets. In addition to its main goal of keeping global temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0C, the High Ambition Coalition introduced <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highambitioncoalition.org\/work\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">other significant climate targets<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the Paris Agreement, including a pathway to net-zero global emissions by the second half of the century and a five-year cycle for countries to update their commitments to mitigate emission reductions.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coalition was formed via the unrelenting politicking of Tony de Brum. Mr. de Brum managed to garner the support of developed and developing countries alike in the months leading up to the 2015 climate summit that finalised the Paris Agreement. Over the final few days of negotiations, Mr. de Brum announced <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2015\/dec\/08\/coalition-paris-push-for-binding-ambitious-climate-change-deal\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the coalition with over 100 unofficial member countries<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and its targets, creating the necessary momentum to incorporate more ambitious goals into the agreement.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Marshall Islands is an equatorial low-lying island country in the Pacific. Together with other similar countries, such as the Maldives, Tuvalu and Kiribati, the Marshall Islands has a vested interest in establishing a 1.5\u00b0C temperature rise target. For these countries, any rise over 1.5\u00b0C will leave them vulnerable to devastating impacts from sea level rise. In fact, Kiribati is set to be the first country to be submerged as a result of climate change.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As developed nations struggle to meet the general targets of the Paris Agreement, let alone the more ambitious ones, countries such as the Marshall Islands are poised to be the first to suffer from the most severe effects of climate change in the shape of climate-induced migration. At this stage, the question of whether or not forced migration can be avoided is becoming increasingly irrelevant. Rather, understanding how to alleviate social impacts will be crucial. The nature of the High Ambition Coalition\u2019s formation indicates that such targets may still be achievable through dedicated coordination and leadership.<\/span><\/p><p><b>\u20181.5 to Stay Alive\u2019<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the buildup to the Paris negotiations, an unofficial global campaign emerged that called for ambitious temperature rise mitigation targets.

Common concerns over the impacts of climate change on these lands led to the formation of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) in 1990. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aosis.org\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AOSIS<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an intergovernmental organisation that consolidates the voices of small island developing states (SIDS) with regards to climate change and sea level rise. The organisation acts as a coordinated force for SIDS to address the United Nations and other transnational institutions.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the impacts of climate change may still appear as an abstraction in many parts of the world, the threat of sea level rise for SIDS such as the Marshall Islands is tangible and urgent.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Marshall Islands <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/library\/publications\/the-world-factbook\/geos\/rm.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are spread<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over 29 atolls, comprising a total of around 1 225 islands and islets. The highest elevation on the Marshall Islands at high tide is six metres, with the majority existing at under two metres above sea level. The furthest inland point is around 600 metres from the coast, although this is an anomaly. For the most part, the islands are flanked closely by water on both sides, and most Marshallese residents live only a few minutes walk from the shore.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These factors make the Marshall Islands, and many other SIDS, vulnerable to even small changes in sea level. While narratives of sinking islands being reclaimed by the sea tend to prevail in the public eye, this is misleading, as low-lying landforms become uninhabitable long before they disappear beneath the water. Sea level rise causes land loss; before land is submerged it is deprived of any and all value due to extensive waterlogging, erosion and salinisation. Combined with persistent droughts, land where people live and work can rapidly become unusable and unsafe.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Particularly strong seasonal high tides, known as king tides, are predictable events that naturally occur fewer than five times a year, often damaging buildings and farms and forcing people to evacuate. The inundations caused by king tides provide a glimpse of future damages, as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/cre\/king-tides-and-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rising sea levels<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will make king tide-level flooding the norm year-round. The damage caused by king tides is exacerbated by deteriorating natural reef barriers offshore.<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-deniers-shift-tactics-to-inactivism\/\" target=\"_blank\">Climate Deniers Shift Tactics to \u2018Inactivism\u2019<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p> <img alt=\"high ambition coalition\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-20268 size-large\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-47-1024x510.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-47-1024x510.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-47-300x149.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-47-768x382.jpg 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-47.jpg 1262w\" height=\"510\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20510'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"1024\"><noscript><img alt=\"high ambition coalition\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-20268 size-large\" height=\"510\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-47-1024x510.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-47-1024x510.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-47-300x149.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-47-768x382.jpg 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-47.jpg 1262w\" width=\"1024\"\/><\/noscript> <img alt=\"high ambition coalition\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-20269 size-large\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-48-1024x527.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-48-1024x527.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-48-300x154.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-48-768x395.jpg 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-48.jpg 1264w\" height=\"527\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20527'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"1024\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"high ambition coalition\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-20269 size-large\" height=\"527\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-48-1024x527.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-48-1024x527.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-48-300x154.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-48-768x395.jpg 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-48.jpg 1264w\" width=\"1024\"\/><\/noscript><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/ng-interactive\/2015\/mar\/11\/climate-change-in-the-marshall-islands-and-kiribati-before-and-after-interactive\" target=\"_blank\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Image 1<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Difference between regular water levels and king tides off the coast of Majuro, capital of the Marshall Islands; The Guardian; 2015.<\/span><\/i><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hawaii.edu\/news\/2020\/10\/30\/sea-level-rise-atoll-communities\/#:~:text=The%20results%20suggest%20higher%20water,leading%20up%20to%20mid%2Dcentury.\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the University of Hawaii examined the potential impacts of unmitigated emissions and sea level rise over the course of the century on the Marshall Islands, specifically addressing the issue of salinisation.

The High Ambition Coalition was born through informal discussions during preliminary climate summits in mid-2015. By the time of the Paris negotiations in December, de Brum was in regular meetings with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2015\/dec\/08\/coalition-paris-push-for-binding-ambitious-climate-change-deal\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ministers and representatives from across the world<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the EU climate commissioner, and Todd Stern, the US chief negotiator.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of its announcement during the final days of negotiations, the coalition included poor and wealthy nations alike. De Brum emphasised the resilience of the coalition\u2019s goals, and how they addressed the needs of all nations, stating: \u201cThis group is not going to allow this thing to be diluted to the point that it\u2019s a watered down agreement with really no teeth. I think that\u2019s important. And also that we will not leave anyone behind.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain high emitter countries opposed some of the coalition\u2019s targets. India, for instance, was opposed to the idea of reviewing emission targets every five years. The US lobbied against making certain goals of the coalition legally binding, such as the requirements for wealthy countries to financially support energy transitions in the developing world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, despite the objections, the goals of the High Ambition Coalition were written into the Paris Agreement. D<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e Brum\u2019s successful efforts to bridge international divides deserve to be acknowledged. The Marshallese representative managed to, at least temporarily, broker a global alliance that transcended political squabbles between nations, and arguably dragged the Paris negotiations across the finish line.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tony de Brum passed away in Majuro, capital of the Marshall Islands in 2017. Speaking of de Brum\u2019s role in mediating the signing of the Paris Agreement, Todd Stern said: \u201cWe all owe a debt to Tony for getting Paris done. When I think of people who were meaningful in getting the Paris deal, he is definitely on the short list.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite de Brum\u2019s passing and the group\u2019s informal structure, the coalition continues to be a vocal actor at the transnational level. The High Ambition Coalition has recently outlined <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highambitioncoalition.org\/statements\/press-release-green-recovery\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">plans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to address a green recovery from recessions induced by COVID-19, specifically discussing how up to 60% of global recovery spending could be directed towards developing a green economy and low-carbon jobs.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In view of the UN\u2019s 26th Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November 2021, the High Ambition Coalition released <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highambitioncoalition.org\/statements\/uniting-behind-the-science-to-step-up-ambition-by-2020\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a statement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in February 2020, cosigned by various EU member states, SIDS and other countries. The statement reaffirmed the High Ambition Coalition\u2019s targets, specifically to review countries\u2019 NDC plans. Five years on from the original Paris negotiations, countries will have to present updated plans to reduce emissions at COP26. The coalition aims to ensure the delivery of these updated NDCs, as well as long-term greenhouse gas reduction strategies, national adaptation plans and climate finance commitments.<\/span><\/p><p><b>Failures of Jurisdictional Enforcement<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The High Ambition Coalition served a pivotal role to affirm the Paris Agreement, and can continue to be a major uniting force in policing and pressuring other Paris signatories. However, despite best intentions, jurisdictional failures to enforce mitigation measures continue to present a significant obstacle.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main criticism that is justifiably levied against the High Ambition Coalition is that many of its unofficial members are not on track to even meet the 2\u00b0C goal. For instance, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/climateactiontracker.org\/countries\/eu\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EU member states<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have been frequent participants in pledges and statements made by the High Ambition Coalition, however, if all countries emitted at the same rate as the average EU state, global temperature rise by 2100 would be between 2 and 3\u00b0C.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current best-case scenarios place global temperature rise at a median <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/climateactiontracker.org\/global\/temperatures\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.1\u00b0C<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by 2100.

For the Marshall Islands and other countries in similar circumstances, the often-unarticulated impacts of climate change are rapidly becoming reality.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>The Marshall Islands\u2019 Cautionary Tale<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the most severe global impacts of climate change may yet be avoided or at least mitigated, current emissions rates and projections indicate that many developing countries with fewer resources will encounter significant challenges over the coming decades. As one of the first countries to suffer the brunt of climate change and resulting forced migration, the Marshall Islands may provide an early blueprint of the political reality behind climate migration.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the context of migration, the Marshall Islands has been a beneficiary of a unique compact of free association with the US since 1986. The compact developed as a means of reparations on behalf of the US. During World War II, the US used the Marshall Islands as a nuclear testing site, specifically the Bikini Atoll, causing large-scale evacuations and relocations. Swathes of ancestral land remain <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/65949-marshall-islands-more-radioactivity-chernobyl.html#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20Marshall%20Islands,islands%2C%20a%20new%20study%20finds.\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highly radioactive to this day<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The compact absolved the US of any legal responsibility related to its nuclear testing program, while granting the Marshall Islands government a reparatory payment of $150 million and certain rights for Marshallese citizens.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among other things, the compact allows Marshallese citizens freedom to study, work and live in the US without the need for visas or permits. As a result, many Marshallese have moved to the US since the compact was agreed upon. As of 2018, approximately <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/show\/marshall-islands-a-third-of-the-nation-has-left-for-the-us\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one third<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Marshallese citizens live in the US, around 30 000 people.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/collections.unu.edu\/eserv\/UNU:7623\/vanderGeest_et_al_2020_Climate_ESS_Migration_RMI_META.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 2020 study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> analysed the links between migration trends, climate change and ecological services. Climate change was not often cited as a direct reason behind the decision to emigrate. Primary motivations were education, healthcare, employment and family visits. However, a more nuanced analysis of respondents\u2019 answers revealed how climate change has indirectly influenced migration.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As ecological services collapse, meaning that the land is increasingly unable to provide for basic needs, residents become open to leaving. For an economy still reliant on agricultural production, deteriorating ecological services has led to a substantial rise in unemployment. More diversified employment opportunities in the US therefore become an appealing option for the Marshallese. The study also found that 62% of Marshallese migrants felt that, due to environmental concerns, a future return to the islands would not be possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It should be noted that more research on the motivations behind these migrations is required, as empirical studies of climate change-induced migrations are sparse and the field is in its relative infancy.<\/span><\/p> <img alt=\"high ambition coalition\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-20271 size-full\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-50.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-50.jpg 804w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-50-300x141.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-50-768x362.jpg 768w\" height=\"379\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20804%20379'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"804\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"high ambition coalition\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-20271 size-full\" height=\"379\" sizes=\"(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-50.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-50.jpg 804w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-50-300x141.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-50-768x362.jpg 768w\" width=\"804\"\/><\/noscript><p><a href=\"https:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/596d5a162e69cf240a0f043b\/t\/5e3115f8d56e0e36eb060e7f\/1580275205756\/MICMP2019_SummaryforPolicymakers.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fig.2<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: How climate change will impact migrations; The Marshall Islands Climate &amp; Migration Project; 2019.<\/span><\/i><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emigrants\u2019 concerns over worsening healthcare standards are also indirectly tied to climate change.

Between July 2019 and January 2020, an outbreak of dengue was presumed to have infected up to 8 000 of the Marshall Islands\u2019 resident population of 53 000. As the islands\u2019 climate warms, the country is becoming an increasingly suitable <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.directrelief.org\/2019\/10\/this-is-the-worst-dengue-year-in-nearly-a-decade-it-may-get-worse-from-here\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breeding ground<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the species of mosquito that carries dengue, among other serious diseases.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The options for Marshallese residents are either to stay and manage dramatic lifestyle changes for as long as they can, or leave. Given current trends, the end outcome will be the same, the only variable being time.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is what climate change will soon look like on a global scale.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case of the Marshall Islands demonstrates how future climate change-induced migrations could play out. People tend to migrate not because of climate change itself, but because of how a changing climate can affect employment, livelihoods, health, food security and overall well-being. These impacts will be felt long before land becomes completely uninhabitable, and under current trends will drive mass movements from affected countries over the coming decades.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developing countries will be the most severely affected. This is partly due to circumstance, as the tropical countries that will be most impacted by climate change tend to be developing states. Reliance on agriculture and lack of capital that can compensate for deteriorating ecological services also plays a role. Policymakers in wealthier countries will need to begin planning for the massive scale of this eventuality, and incorporate institutional structures that can support climate refugees.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once more, the circumstances of the Marshall Islands present a potential blueprint for countries to follow. The Marshall Islands-US compact permits freedom of movement and work between the two countries. This has allowed communities of Marshallese to grow within the US over the past 30 years. By far the largest expatriated Marshallese community is in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12134-019-00688-7\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Springdale, Arkansas<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a city with a population of around 70 000 that is home to 15 000 Marshallese. Springdale is the headquarters of Tyson Foods, the world\u2019s largest poultry producer, and has attracted Marshallese workers since the 1980s. Springdale boasts 35 Marshallese churches, a consulate and a number of nonprofit organisations supporting migrants and promoting Marshallese culture.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jobs such as those provided by poultry producers in Springdale are widely available and do not require skilled labour, allowing any migrant to start working immediately upon arrival. The value of this freedom of movement should not be underestimated. It is a right that most migrants wait years or decades to obtain.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar policies modelled on the Marshall Islands-US compact will need to be implemented on a much larger scale globally to accommodate future climate refugees. Compacts that can waive or expedite work permits and visas can facilitate adjustments. Keeping communities together with robust support systems in environments such as Springdale will also be critical.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No model or policy will ever be ideal. In the case of the Marshall Islands, over 3 000 years of history and culture that is inextricably tied to the land is being effaced in the span of less than a century. Relocating entire populations to other countries brings a set of cultural and linguistic difficulties. Children born abroad will encounter challenges reconciling their heritage without a physical attachment to history through land. A nation relies on its land as an embodiment of permanence, and when land is faced with the constant threat of irreversible erasure, a population can lose a critical link to its identity. People can move easily, a nation cannot.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plight of the Marshall Islands and its people demonstrates what effects unmitigated climate change will have in the long term, and it highlights who will pay the highest cost.

The territory\u2019s mountainous geography, its tropical climate and a lack of flat land have presented persistent challenges to urban developers in Hong Kong. In addition to the city\u2019s seaward expansion through land reclamation projects, it has also migrated skyward, tracing the slopes of coastal mountains and hills. Through complex slope stability and rainwater drainage systems, residential buildings and urban dwellers have settled upon the territory\u2019s steep hillsides.

Rainfall tends to be the most common cause of landslides, which can occur when precipitation rates exceed 70 mm per hour, although this is also dependent on other factors including soil integrity. Short bursts of intense rain can cause rapid erosion and soil destabilisation, leading to slope failure.

Recognising the fatal risks of slope failure and landslides, the Hong Kong government has implemented a variety of slope maintenance and rainwater drainage measures that protect the city\u2019s residents and infrastructure from landslides.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broadly, the main trigger for landslides is heavy rainfall, and the magnitude and impact of a slope failure event is compounded by population density and human activity. However, a warming climate and intensifying extreme weather events will present a clear challenge over the coming years. Increasingly severe tropical storms will bring heavier rainfall which, when combined with soil erosion, population growth and continued urban development, will magnify the existing risk to hillside settlements in Hong Kong.<\/span><\/p><p><b>Slope Failures and Mitigation Strategies<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slope failures- when the integrity of hillside soil and rock becomes extensively damaged- are a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0013795298000386\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">common and natural occurrence in Hong Kong<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A mountainous landscape combined with a tropical climate highly increases the probability of slope failure. Urban development and population growth have only added to the natural risk factor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concentration and intensity of rainfall over short periods exacerbate oversaturation and soil erosion. Annually, around 80% of rainfall occurs during the wet season, between May and September. The intensity of rainfall during a tropical storm is such that it is not uncommon for over 10% of annual rainfall to occur over the span of a few hours. During severe storms, precipitation can exceed 400 mm over a 24-hour period. Average precipitation in Hong Kong in a year is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.climatestotravel.com\/climate\/hong-kong\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2400 mm<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The high concentration of precipitation during short bursts of intense rainfall causes a high degree of surface runoff, which occurs when soil is oversaturated and precipitation exceeds the rate at which water can be absorbed. Surface runoff is compounded by urbanisation, as paved surfaces and other man-made structures impede water absorption. Excessive surface runoff can cause spillage from natural water basins such as valleys and depressions, and resultant flooding increases the rate of soil erosion. Under heavy rainfall, spillage and flooding tends to occur either during or immediately after a storm, making landslides and slope failures difficult to predict and plan for.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To minimise the risk of slope failures and landslides, Hong Kong has invested heavily in developing its urban rainwater drainage system. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/hong-kong-rain-tunnel\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 1995<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the city has invested $3.8 billion into projects that include 2 400 km of drains, 360 km of river channels, four underground tunnels that cumulatively span 21 km and four massive stormwater storage tanks, with 11 more tanks slated for construction. The intricate rainwater drainage system in Hong Kong minimises the erosion impact of heavy rainfall on hillside soil by redirecting and storing stormwater in vast containment tanks.<\/span><\/p> <img alt=\"hong kong hillside\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-20030 size-full\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-34-2.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-34-2.jpg 639w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-34-2-300x180.jpg 300w\" height=\"383\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20639%20383'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"639\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"hong kong hillside\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-20030 size-full\" height=\"383\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-34-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-34-2.jpg 639w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/unnamed-34-2-300x180.jpg 300w\" width=\"639\"\/><\/noscript><p><a href=\"https:\/\/chinadialogue.net\/en\/climate\/9575-bracing-for-the-flood-in-hong-kong-2\/\" target=\"_blank\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Image 2<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Visualisation of Hong Kong\u2019s stormwater drainage system; China Dialogue; 2017.<\/span><\/i><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the 1972 landslides, the Hong Kong government acknowledged the risks of urban development on steep slopes.

Should similar rainfall occur near the heavily developed and populated slopes of Hong Kong, the impact would be catastrophic.<\/span><\/p><p><b>Steps for Risk Mitigation<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hong Kong will need to accomplish several tasks to be prepared for the consequences of more frequent and intense rainfall during its wet season. Specifically, the city will need to strengthen its existing drainage infrastructure, enhance institutional capacity for community preparedness and response systems and minimise the degrading impact of human activity on natural systems.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first two challenges are somewhat linked, in that emergency preparedness systems can be integrated with strengthened drainage and slope maintenance systems. The Landslip Warning System is a good example of the benefits of an IoT approach to surveillance and monitoring. IoT technology allows officials to coordinate separate but fundamental components of an effective risk analysis. It could, for instance, instantly reconcile precipitation rate data collected by the Hong Kong Observatory during a tropical storm, soil quality and slope integrity data collected by the GEO and local drainage capacity data from the Department of Drainage Services. A more expansive IoT approach can incorporate immediate emergency response in terms of issuing community evacuation notices and mobilising rescue operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As important as engineering and innovative technology will be, raising public awareness of the dangers of slope failure will be crucial, especially in more at-risk areas. The government could focus on developing an educational public communications campaign, involving publicity events in neighbourhoods more prone to landslide damage and producing informational public messaging on social media and television. Officials can also organise public committees on slopes which involve residents and private landowners to more actively engage the public. Costs could be minimised by focusing campaigning efforts during the weeks and months leading up to the wet season.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To mitigate the impact of urban development in aggravating landslide risks, city planners will need to reconcile demands for more liveable space with minimising environmental impact. A strategy that the city could pursue is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.hk\/en\/residents\/environment\/sustainable\/greening.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">green roofing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a practice that Hong Kong has already somewhat embraced. A green roof consists of three layers, a top layer covered in vegetation, a substrate dividing layer and a bottom drainage layer. The soil and vegetation on green roofs can help absorb, drain and eventually transpire rainwater where it would otherwise become surface runoff.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green roofs can be effective in alleviating the strain placed on urban drainage systems during heavy rainfall, as they can free up more space in drainage tunnels and storage tanks. Green roofs can also delay spillage events when man-made and natural drainage systems become oversaturated, by lowering the overall amount of surface runoff water. In addition to stormwater absorption, green roofs increase biodiversity and provide urban cooling and ventilation. Green surfaces can also be applied to building walls, highway infrastructures and slope retaining walls. Green roofs present some drawbacks, in that they need to be scaled up significantly to have a measurable impact. Green roofing as a policy measure has also been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/comment\/insight-opinion\/article\/1963431\/do-green-roofs-really-have-any-environmental-benefits-hong\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">criticised<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for deterring cities from investing in more effective green spaces on the ground.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Hong Kong\u2019s engineering systems may assuage concerns about slope failure damage, the risk of landslides is real, and will become progressively more threatening as the climate continues to warm. Tropical storms and heavy rainfall will never be completely avoidable, although the city can mitigate their consequences, without necessarily having to sacrifice development targets.

Unlike cats, who are obligate carnivores, meaning they literally need to consume meat to maintain their health, dogs are omnivorous animals for whom a meat-based diet is optional like us and not necessary. \u201cDogs are omnivores, which means they have a pretty adaptable [gastrointestinal] tract, and that their nutritional needs can be met through different means,\u201d said Amy Farcas, a clinical veterinary nutritionist at the University of Pennsylvania.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt is OK for dogs to be fed a vegetarian or vegan diet \u2013 with the caveat that they are correctly balanced,\u201d Farcas says. While <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/wildearth.com\/pages\/vegan-dog-food\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vegan dog food<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> seems like an idea that may take some getting used to, the fact is that at one time the idea of feeding a dog a prized foodstuff like meat was considered the height of foolishness. It\u2019s only relatively recently that humans have begun feeding their dogs diets high in meat and animal based proteins as dog\u2019s co-evolved with us to essentially eat what we ate as humans. Modern vegan dog foods include a whole host of healthy proteins from yeast, fungi, and algae. They\u2019re formulated to offer complete proteins. These ingredients are all approved by AAFCO in the US and FEDIAF guidelines in the UK to ensure that the food includes the nutrients that dogs need to thrive.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.petfoodinstitute.org\/pet-food-matters\/nutrition-2\/history-of-pet-food\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">supermarket pet food<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> proliferated in the 1960\u2019s fuelled by images of our dogs as wolves our currently prevailing attitudes were shaped by slick advertising campaigns similar to those which convinced people that meat was a necessary part of our diets (it wasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t) that curiously enough, wasn\u2019t about the health of our cats and dogs but selling us an image of our domestic pets as wild animals (which they aren\u2019t and weren\u2019t). In addition, as large scale pet food companies started to cut corners with the quality of their meats, including contaminated and diseased meats which have led to millions of dog and cat food products being recalled, pet parents have increasingly been opting for vegan and human grade pet foods that haven\u2019t had the same health risks.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the effects of our over-industrialised global society continues to yield increasingly horrific and disastrous environmental consequences for all of us, now is the time to revisit how we feed our pets. No one is expecting people to get rid of their pets because of their carbon footprint, but we should be mindful of how every action, no matter how small, has a consequence.<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/carbon-footprint-of-our-pets\/"},"Page 11":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Arctic Sea Ice Has Yet to Freeze at Latest Date on Record<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Oct 23rd 2020<\/span><span>2 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Arctic Sea Ice Has Yet to Freeze at Latest Date on Record\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/6151061573_7023960f2f_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Arctic Sea Ice Has Yet to Freeze at Latest Date on Record\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/6151061573_7023960f2f_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>The main nursery of Arctic sea ice in Siberia has yet to freeze in late October for the first time since records began.

If this ice forms late in the Laptev Sea, it will be thinner and more likely to melt before it reaches the Fram Strait. This could result in fewer nutrients for Arctic plankton, which will lose its ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Further, more open sea also means more turbulence in the upper layer of the Arctic ocean, which will bring up more warm water from the deeper parts.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This feedback loop is something that has been forecast for a long time, so it should come as no surprise that we are starting to see it happen. However, there has been little response by lawmakers to reverse or even slow down this process.

By the end of the 90-minute debate, most Americans were left with unanswered questions and headaches. It was widely considered a low point for US politics by voters on both sides.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Trump used his speaking time to put forward unsubstantiated claims about his administration\u2019s efforts to protect America\u2019s air and water resources, despite the fact that he has\u00a0 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2020\/climate\/trump-environment-rollbacks.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rolled back over 100 major climate and environmental policies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during his term.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive policy makers and climate activists, which sets goals for drastic measures to cut carbon emissions across the US. The GND is favoured by many liberal voters, particularly young progressives who supported democratic socialist candidate Senator Bernie Sanders and progressive candidate Elizabeth Warren in the primary elections, and have been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/today.yougov.com\/topics\/politics\/articles-reports\/2020\/08\/07\/bernie-sanders-supporters-reluctantly-join-joe-bid\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reluctant to extend their support<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to democratic nominee Joe Biden. However, the GND is seen by conservatives and many moderate voters as too \u201cradical.\u201d Biden is tasked with the challenge of maintaining the support of those on the far left who want to see immediate and extreme measures taken to combat the climate crisis, as well as those in the center who worry about the effects such a drastic plan will have on the economy.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This official rejection came in response to a barrage of interruptions and insults by President Trump, who accused Biden of supporting a \u201cradical left\u201d plan that would cost $100 trillion <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.factcheck.org\/2019\/03\/how-much-will-the-green-new-deal-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(a number determined by a right wing policy group)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t support the Green New Deal\u2026 I support the Biden Plan that I have just put forward, which is different from what [Trump] calls the radical Green New Deal,\u201d Biden responded, simultaneously distancing himself from progressive policy makers on the far left while promoting an ambitious climate plan that still draws inspiration from the GND.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unclear how voters will respond to Biden\u2019s bold rejection of the Green New Deal come the November election, or whether Trump\u2019s decision not to put forth any comprehensive climate action plan at all during the debate will have an effect on his re-election prospects. What <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> clear, is that the topic of the climate crisis is officially at the forefront of American politics in a way that has never been seen before, and that there is a growing consensus in the US that this is a serious problem which requires action.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/guardian-vice-poll-finds-most-us-2020-voters-strongly-favour-climate-action\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent poll<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Climate Nexus, the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication, shows that the political landscape among voters appears to be shifting.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seven in ten US voters support government action to address the climate crisis \u2013 and young Republicans are less accepting of their party\u2019s inaction.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump\u2019s own admission that global warming is human-induced (even if he believes only \u201cto an extent\u201d), is important because it demonstrates a broader cultural shift in the American public\u2019s view on climate change.

A new pilot plan in Arizona hopes to accomplish this goal by selectively cutting some of the trees in the forest\u2014a strategy known as forest thinning \u2013 and selling the felled timber as wood chips to South Korean buyers. It seems like a win-win solution: the forests are preserved, and communities gain some fire safety and make some money in the process. How does it work?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>B<\/strong>esides climate change, the general consensus, according to Sharon Hood and her colleagues, writing in the journal Ecological Application, is that the growth in catastrophic fires stems from decades of overzealous fire suppression. Without fire, too many trees survive and grow. Old and young trees cram unnaturally close together, making forests more vulnerable not only to severe fire, but to disease and pest infestation. Infestations can kill trees, resulting in more dry fuel, and an even greater risk of catastrophic fire.<\/p><p>Working in Ponderosa Pine forests, in western Montana, Sharon Hood and her colleagues examined how different fire treatments affected the forest\u2019s ability to withstand infestation by the mountain pine beetle, a pest that can leave huge swaths of trees dead\u2014and susceptible to fire. In the densely packed forests that had not burned recently, pine beetles killed as many as 50% of trees. The researchers wanted to test whether forest thinning, controlled burning, or a combination of both might prevent beetle infestations and increase overall fire resistance.<\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/norway-whaling-catch-hits-four-year-high\/\" target=\"_blank\">481 and Counting: Norway\u2019s Whaling Catch Hits Four-Year High<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Simply burning the forest helped control beetles, but not much. In areas exposed only to fire, tree mortality was lower than in unburned forests, but still quite high. However, when forests were thinned, or thinned in combination with burning, tree deaths from pine beetle infestation declined almost to zero. Thinning alone, and thinning and burning together, were so successful that even forest already coping with a beetle outbreak became fire resistant.<\/p><p>If left unburned or unthinned, beetle attacks eventually shifted the entire character of the forest by shifting the dominant tree species. Thinning, then, can help to reduce the risk of severe fire not only by reducing the dangerous fuel buildup in unburned forests, but by helping the forest resist beetle infestation and the increased fire risk that infestation brings.<\/p><p>You may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the provided link on any marketing message.<br\/> The conclusion is that at least in the short term, proper forest thinning has the potential to drastically reduce not only fire danger but other threats as well. Hood and colleagues note that while thinning is highly effective in the short term, in the long term, forest health requires the restoration of a normal fire regime. If tree density isn\u2019t maintained at a natural level, the whole process will need to be repeated.<\/p><p>Thinning needs to be done properly. It should not be an excuse for backdoor logging, as removal of older, mature trees is not as helpful as removing the smaller trees that fuel massive fires. The scheme to sell the thinned wood as chips is kind of genius, as the small scrubby trees being thinned have little value for anything else. One caveat is that the chips will be burned as fuel, so from a carbon storage perspective, the solution is not ideal. On the other hand, if the trees would have burned in a fire anyway, maybe that doesn\u2019t matter.<em><em>Featured image by: <a class=\"owner-name truncate\" data-track=\"attributionNameClick\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/blmnevada\/42885291605\/in\/photolist-28kCk6p-2aeWcB6-rHXN69-27Zr2ek-N8Huai-28TAthq-22pRqwu-4rUmK2-ZgVUud-KfPtg9-M8hM9C-21qJPtk-29x5nSr-RUBvfX-2ft4sAU-297aCNT-22vWHJi-HpCGPV-9cjF4o-22dkbUe-dJzANP-dJF4Qs-2duux31-236zyJU-ZyUxu7-29JbpvD-ptK8wr-2aV7FxW-2bfFYab-27VfdrR-JWSesP-21oiMss-2187z1A-2fAtwkX-JVGR5h-nuJkKx-HpCGUe-4P7Uwz-2amSXdv-CUjjmR-HpCGRi-25QE1fS-2682jxC-ECNStm-QhcHTA-2euuAm7-22L59ux-21isWz8-27B926Q-28wm84S\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Go to BLM Nevada's photostream\">BLM Nevada<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>This article was <a href=\"https:\/\/daily.jstor.org\/does-forest-thinning-work\/\" target=\"_blank\">originally published on JSTOR Daily<\/a>, written by James MacDonald\u00a0, and is republished here as part of an editorial partnership with Earth.Org.<\/em><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/forest-thinning\/"},"Page 18":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/policy-and-economics\">Policy &amp; Economics<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">What is \u2018Tragedy of the Commons\u2019?<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Aug 25th 2020<\/span><span>5 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"What is \u2018Tragedy of the Commons\u2019?\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-08-25T131853.188.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"What is \u2018Tragedy of the Commons\u2019?\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-08-25T131853.188.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>First posited in 1968 by American ecologist Garret Hardin, the <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.cornell.edu\/info2040\/2015\/12\/02\/tragedy-of-the-commons-the-environment\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tragedy of the Commons<\/a> describes a situation where shared environmental resources are overused and exploited, and eventually depleted, posing risks to everyone involved. Hardin argues that to prevent this, there should be some restrictions to the amount of usage, for example, property rights must be affixed.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><b>What is the Tragedy of the Commons?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardin argues that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/print\/704363-the-tragedy-of-the-commons\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">individual short-term interest<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 to take as much of a resource as possible- is in opposition to societal good. If everyone was to act on this individual interest, the situation would worsen for society as a whole- demand for a shared resource would overshadow the supply, and the resource would eventually become entirely unavailable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversely, exercising restraint would yield benefits for all in the long-term, as the shared resource would remain available.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>What Are Some Examples of the Tragedy of the Commons?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arguably the best examples of this phenomenon occur in situations that lead to environmental degradation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among many things, pollution is caused by wastewater. As the number of households and companies increase and dump their waste into the water, the water loses its ability to clean itself. This results in water that is toxic to wildlife and the people that live around and rely on it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example of the Tragedy of the Commons lies in overfishing. In Canada, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/print\/704363-the-tragedy-of-the-commons\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grand Banks fishery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> off the coast of Newfoundland was a means of livelihood for regional fishermen. Abundant in cod, the fishery allowed fishermen to catch as many cod as they desired without negatively impacting their population.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, in the 1960s, advancements in technology allowed fishermen to catch vast quantities of cod, far more than before. However, with each passing season, the amount of cod deteriorated and by the 1990s, the fishing industry in the region collapsed because there wasn\u2019t enough fish to go around. This situation where individual fishermen took advantage of opportunities to benefit themselves in the short term, even when their actions were clearly detrimental to society in the long term, encapsulates the self-preserving mindset behind the Tragedy of the Commons. These fishermen thought logically, but not collectively, which led to their downfall.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Tragedy of the Commons can also be applied to the COVID-19 pandemic still plaguing the planet. In its early days, people were generally wary of mixing with anyone outside their immediate family, leaving their homes less and working from home. However, another result of the pandemic was that people began to stock up on food and utilities. People likely assumed that everyone else would stock up as well and so the only solution was to preempt this scenario and stockpile food before the next person could. Again, people were thinking logically, but not collectively, and herein lies the relevance of the Tragedy of the Commons. Individuals took advantage of opportunities that benefited themselves, but spread out the harmful effects of their consumption across society.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retailers responded by imposing restrictions on the number of items one could buy, but it was too late.

Each country can only manage and protect the ocean resources along its coastlines, leaving the shared common space beyond any particular jurisdiction vulnerable to pollution. This has led to obscene amounts of ocean pollution, as seen in garbage patches that accumulate in the center of circular currents, for example. This will affect everyone as these pollutants cycle through the marine food chain, and then humans as we consume fish. Another problem facing the oceans are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/what-is-a-dead-zone\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dead zones<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, areas in lakes and oceans where no marine life can live because of the lack of oxygen caused by excessive pollution and fertiliser runoff.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dummies.com\/education\/science\/environmental-science\/ten-real-life-examples-of-the-tragedy-of-the-commons\/\" target=\"_blank\">The atmosphere<\/a> is another resource being used and abused, as are forests. Unregulated and illegal logging pose great risks to forests\u2019 ability to store carbon. In some parts of the world, vast expanses of rainforests aren\u2019t governed in a way that allows effective management for resource extraction. Timber producers are driven to take as much timber as possible as cheaply as possible, without considering the wider impacts of doing so.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor governance exacerbates the problem of the Tragedy of the Commons.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Who is Meant to Fix It?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, governments at the local, state, national and international levels would <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/science\/tragedy-of-the-commons\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">define and manage shared resources<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, there are problems with this. Management inside clear boundaries is quite straightforward, but more problematic are resources shared across jurisdictions. For example, at the international level, states are not bound by a common authority and may view restrictions on resource extraction as a threat to their sovereignty. Additionally, more difficulties arise when resources cannot be divided, such as in whale treaties when the fishing of the whales\u2019 food source is separately regulated.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Economist Scott Barrett at Columbia University in New York says that international law \u201chas no teeth, so treaties are essentially voluntary. \u201cEven when countries decide to take part in collective conservation efforts, they can simply pull out again when they want to,\u201d as Canada did in 2011 when it <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/114\/1\/7\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and when America withdrew from the Paris Agreement in late 2019.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the global population increases and demand for resources follows, the downsides of the Commons become more apparent. Some may argue that this will test the role and practicality of nation-states, leading to a redefinition of international governance. Further, it may lead some to question the role of supranational governments, such as the UN or the World Trade Organization; as resources become more limited, some may argue that managing the commons may not have a solution at all.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>What Can Be Done?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A potential solution to this is to affix property rights to public spaces.

VPD is a combined function of air temperature and relative humidity and is a critical variable in determining plant photosynthesis. Higher VPD values indicate a decline in atmospheric moisture. This implies that the Amazon is likely to increasingly struggle to sustain its water demands, triggering more widespread and severe droughts.

However, the Amazon rainforest is extremely vulnerable to increases in atmospheric drying and warming, as they are thought to produce up to 80% of their own rainfall.

A drought in California between 2011 and 2015 killed an\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/31066121\/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">estimated 140 million trees<\/a>\u00a0and caused the state\u2019s ecosystem to be a net source of carbon rather than a sink. The disturbance accounted for 10% of the state\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions from that time period.<\/p><p>Biotic agents such as insects and plant diseases also present a huge challenge to forests and forest management. The\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/nature06777\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mountain pine beetle<\/a>\u00a0(<em>Dendroctonus ponderosae<\/em>), for example, is responsible for the deaths of billions of trees in temperate and boreal coniferous forests. At this point, science does not have a good way of predicting where, when, and to what extent these threats will present.<\/p><p>Anderegg and a group of global experts gathered in 2019 to talk about natural climate solutions. Here, they asked: How can we assess the risks to forest permanence? What can science contribute to be sure forest-based solutions are good investments for the climate? And how can we get that information to land managers and policymakers?<\/p><p>The newly published paper in\u00a0<em>Science<\/em>\u00a0was one of the outcomes of that meeting. In it, the authors provide a road map for assessing risks to forest permanence. Forest plot data, remote sensing, and mechanistic vegetation modeling are highlighted as some of the best scientific tools available.<\/p><p>Combining long-term satellite records with forest plot data, for instance, can provide solid estimates for future forest stress and disturbance.\u00a0 Computer\u00a0models\u00a0in climate risks as well as models of tree growth and fire disturbance are also becoming more advanced.<\/p><p>However, because much of the forest plot data is collected in temperate forests, tropical forests have large gaps in data and monitoring. Also, many of these cutting-edge tools and techniques are not widely used outside of the scientific community, meaning policy decisions sometimes rely on science that is decades old.<\/p><p>The authors urge policymakers to be sure forest-based, natural climate solutions are done with the best available science. Likewise, scientists are urged to improve tools for sharing information across different groups outside of science.<\/p><p>Publicly available, easily usable and open-source tools to connect decision and policymakers to science and data are a priority, and something Anderegg and colleagues are currently working to create. The hope is that these tools will inform local decision-making based on current scientific understanding.<\/p><p>Beyond assessing risks to forests, the authors stress the importance of investing in forests in both an ecologically and socially responsible way.<\/p><p>\u201cPlanting native tree species and perhaps a diversity of tree species, involving local communities, and respecting indigenous communities and their rights in these forestry efforts are some of the ways to do this,\u201d Anderegg said.<\/p><p>Another key point is to be mindful of how and where forests are planted. Across the high latitudes in Canada or Russia, for instance, the reflective nature of the snow cools the planet. So planting trees in these areas and covering the snow would actually tend to heat up the planet.<\/p><p>Finally, programs that offset carbon emissions by creating and protecting forests, while critical, should not distract from the simultaneously urgent matter of reducing fossil fuel emissions.<\/p><p>\u201cThere has been a tendency over the years, and it resurges every now and then, to put too much faith in forests or tree planting as a climate change solution,\u201d Nepstad said. \u201cFirst and foremost, we have to decarbonize the economy and move beyond fossil fuels, and that message has come through in this paper.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cKeep in mind that there are lots of other reasons that we want to protect, conserve and perhaps restore forests,\u201d Anderegg said, \u201csuch as biodiversity benefits, clean air, clean water, ecosystem services and tourism\u2026Forests are about more than carbon.\u201d<\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>This article was <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2020\/06\/forests-are-a-solution-to-global-warming-theyre-also-vulnerable-to-it\/\" target=\"_blank\">originally published on Mongabay<\/a>, written by Liz Kimbrough, and is republished here as part of an editorial partnership with Earth.Org.<\/em><\/em><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/forests-solution-to-climate-change-theyre-also-vulnerable-to-it\/"},"Page 21":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/energy\">Energy<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Climate Hypocrite: Canada Continues To Prop Up Fossil Fuels<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/carol-konyn\/\">Carol Konyn<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <\/span><span>Jul 31st 2020<\/span><span>5 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Climate Hypocrite: Canada Continues To Prop Up Fossil Fuels\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/6860868769_e6603fe086_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Climate Hypocrite: Canada Continues To Prop Up Fossil Fuels\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/6860868769_e6603fe086_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>On June 18 2019, the Canadian government declared a national climate emergency.

Canada has struggled to establish their natural resources development plans in shifting towards a greener society and divesting from fossil fuels. The Canadian government\u2019s support for proposed pipelines and pipeline extension projects risk the country\u2019s reputation of being one of the few who have shown strong leadership in addressing the climate crisis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carbon Tracker, an independent financial think tank that assesses climate risk, conducted an analysis on the impact of Canada\u2019s pipelines, and found that new oil sands are unnecessary in a low carbon world. The analysis showed that additional pipeline capacity significantly exceeds supply levels across two low carbon demand scenarios, meaning that large portions will end up wasted or underutilised, resulting in stranded assets. Even in the case where new pipelines have lower crude transportation costs and reduce pricing, for example, the entirety of Canada\u2019s unsanctioned oil sands projects would still not comply with a Paris-aligned world of weaker oil demand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All proposed new pipelines from Western Canada, primarily Keystone XL and Trans Mountain expansion, do not comply with a Paris-compliant world, the report stated. Under the International Energy Agency\u2019s Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), for instance, all future oil supplies from Western Canada can be accommodated by alterations and replacements made to already existing pipelines- demonstrating there is no need to build new pipelines. Even if greater pipeline capacity is reduced due to quality and transport challenges, and comply with the requirements of a greener society, new projects will remain uneconomic under the SDS, and therefore the appropriateness of such pipeline projects should be reconsidered.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The analysts highlighted that the scenarios used in the report still fall short of the Paris Agreement target to limit global warming to 1.5\u02daC. The analysis showed that the first scenario, the SDS limits warming to 1.7-1.8\u02daC and the second scenario, Beyond 2 Degrees Scenario (B2D2), to 1.6\u02daC.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Economic Viability of Oil Projects<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report stated that \u2018investors in oil sands face depressed cash flows in a low carbon world of falling oil demand and weak pricing, but will be forced to produce or pay the price due to inflexible \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d transport fees for excess new pipeline capacity\u2019.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the Canadian government\u2019s stakes in Keystone XL and Trans Mountain could rely on public tax money, which would be far better spent on environmentally friendly and sustainable projects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada\u2019s leadership position on the climate crisis may be subverted by its support for projects reliant on the failure of the Paris Agreement, indicating that the country\u2019s aspiration of complying with the Paris-aligned world is doubtful.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evidently, there remains a divide between environmental motivation and monetary incentives- such that people tend to perceive the two as mutually exclusive. However, if a global, widespread effort is made towards shifting to a greener economy, then the two will inevitably go hand-in-hand. Without this shift, a limbo between wanting to mitigate the climate crisis and wanting to ensure financial stability will continue to prevail. Because of how vulnerable it is to global warming, it is certainly in Canada \u2019s best interest to divest from use of fossil fuels and instead invest in projects that will green the economy while ensuring profitability.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a class=\"owner-name truncate\" data-track=\"attributionNameClick\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/kk\/6860868769\/in\/photolist-bsgKfR-pSM3EY-nkSBXC-bsv7CV-bVET2q-btYoAT-aqDLE9-bsvySp-bVEP5G-bVERyd-7nsoaW-eqvGg6-bt6WCn-4JDmSu-btWZ2a-btkWoB-pVAHDc-oVuAwq-bshGct-bsTFrZ-bvRKwF-brMFWR-pEM6JR-4chkWQ-bVEUu1-bVENhS-pcZh2R-bVEQdU-bVEVAd-btYva8-bVEWBN-osYZEL-nZeSZQ-58UZ6L-4cdmNg-4cdmqn-ord9fG-ofh6vU-btXRee-aqB6BF-orqdWn-btXLLF-jqUShY-o9NxyU-bt6g9a-bsh2UD-bsJFfe-4WQRX8-a73UHD-nmdjRn\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Go to kris kr\u00fcg's photostream\">kris kr\u00fcg<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-hypocrite-canada-prop-up-fossil-fuels\/"},"Page 22":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/oceans\">Oceans<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Biodiversity in the Deep Ocean Faces Unavoidable Threats from the Climate Crisis \u2013 Study<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/georgina-paxman\/\">Georgina Paxman<\/a><\/span><span>Jul 23rd 2020<\/span><span>5 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Biodiversity in the Deep Ocean Faces Unavoidable Threats from the Climate Crisis \u2013 Study\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/rsz_sarah-lee-pkheqziiyoo-unsplash.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Biodiversity in the Deep Ocean Faces Unavoidable Threats from the Climate Crisis \u2013 Study\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/rsz_sarah-lee-pkheqziiyoo-unsplash.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><b>How will the climate crisis affect biodiversity in the deepest depths of the ocean?

Climate velocities were measured at four depth levels within the ocean: the surface (0 \u2013 200 m), mesopelagic (200 \u2013 1000 m), bathypelagic (1000 \u2013 4000 m) and the abyssopelagic (&gt; 4000 m).\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change-makes-some-fish-smaller-and-others-bigger-study\/\" target=\"_blank\">Climate Change Makes Some Fish Smaller, and Others Bigger, Study Finds<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team analysed climate velocities from the past 50 years and found that between 1955 and 2005, the deep ocean experienced faster climate velocities than the surface waters.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only did the team discover that the deep ocean experienced faster climate velocities during this time, but they were also able to use climate models to predict that climate velocities will become faster at all ocean depths between 2050 and 2100. Even under RCP 2.6, the most optimistic greenhouse gas emissions pathway whereby carbon emissions will decline by 2020 and drop to zero by 2100, climate velocities are expected to increase, highlighting concerns that the future threats to ocean biodiversity may be unavoidable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Queensland Professor and senior researcher on the study, Anthony Richardson, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/environment\/deep-ocean-global-warming-temperature-rise-emissions-a9533726.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stresses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that \u201cbecause of the immense size and depth of the ocean, warming already absorbed at the ocean surface will mix into deeper waters.\u201d The implications of this is that \u201cmarine life in the deep ocean will face escalating threats from ocean warming until the end of the century, no matter what we do now\u201d.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Climate velocities in the mesopelagic layer are projected to increase by seven times under the emissions pathway RCP 2.6, which is four times the velocity experienced at the surface, and the abyssopelagic layer will see velocities five and a half times faster than those currently seen in the surface ocean. Under RCP 8.5, the highest emissions scenario whereby emissions continue to rise throughout the century, the mesopelagic layer could experience climate velocities over 20 times faster than it currently witnesses due to rising ocean temperatures. Therefore under this scenario marine life will undergo significant spatial redistributions, migrating much more quickly than they currently do, in order to reach more favourable ocean temperatures for their survival.<\/span><\/p><p><strong>How does climate change affect the deep sea?<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The climate crisis poses serious implications for biodiversity as it can cause major shifts in the distribution of species within an ecosystem. The majority of species migrate towards the poles as a result of ocean warming, causing intricate connections within food webs to be compromised as the reorganisation of species takes place within the ocean, affecting biodiversity worldwide. This redistribution of species can also have a profound socio-economic effect on ecosystem services provided by biodiversity, such as fishery yields.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relatively stable temperatures characterise much of the water below the surface layer and therefore deep sea species have adapted to these conditions leaving them particularly vulnerable to even the slightest shifts in temperature. Professor Jorge Garc\u00eda Molinos, co-author for this study, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2020\/may\/26\/climate-change-in-deep-oceans-could-be-seven-times-faster-by-middle-of-century-report-says\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201cOur results suggest that deep sea biodiversity is likely to be at greater risk because they are adapted to much more stable thermal environments.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, relatively little is known about how biodiversity responds to climate change below the surface ocean. Research has predominantly focused on the surface waters, where the rate of warming is fastest, and therefore most of the knowledge of how biodiversity re-organises itself spatially in response to climate change is of the upper 200 m of the ocean.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Areas at highest risk of biodiversity threat from the climate crisis can be identified by comparing the magnitude of climate velocity with species richness. Making these comparisons can also highlight areas which could act as potential areas of climate refuge, which could play a key role in marine conservation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As well as experiencing faster climate velocities, ocean food webs face the additional challenge of having their vertical connectivity threatened by the difference in climate velocity direction, which varies at depth. For instance, whilst the dominant direction in which marine life migrates is poleward in the surface waters, this effect decreases with ocean depth, where climate velocities are in multiple directions. This could present a significant challenge to species which depend on organisms in other layers for survival, which will in turn have repercussions for the entire marine food web.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isaac Brito-Morales, a PhD student at the University of Queensland, who led the study <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/environment\/deep-ocean-global-warming-temperature-rise-emissions-a9533726.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reveals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that \u201cin an interesting twist, not only is climate velocity moving at different speeds at different depths in the ocean, but also in different directions which poses huge challenges to the ways we design protected areas\u201d.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mesopelagic layer faces the greatest change in climate velocities of all ocean layers. This is concerning since it is home to an abundance of one of the world\u2019s most common vertebrates \u2013 small mesopelagic fish from the genus Cyclothone. The role these fish play not only in providing biomass to support tuna and squid fisheries but also in their ability to transfer carbon to deeper layers of the ocean, through respiration and excretion, is of great significance and a role that is at increased and uncertain risk under future warming scenarios.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the bathypelagic and abyssopelagic ocean layers, as well as faster climate velocities posing a serious threat to biodiversity, the simultaneous decrease in pH and oxygen levels could result in an additional threat for resident species.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crucially, the challenges faced by the deep ocean demands international cooperation and an interdisciplinary approach. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/environment\/deep-ocean-global-warming-temperature-rise-emissions-a9533726.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Richardson suggests<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that in addition to combatting the climate crisis, focus also needs to be put on creating new protected areas at deep ocean depths by controlling seabed mining and deep-sea bottom fishing in order to preserve marine life.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the deep ocean occupying some of the most remote and uninhabited regions in the world, outwith the limits of national jurisdiction, a recognition of global responsibility is important to effectively conserve these areas and mitigate the effects of the climate crisis on the biodiversity in some of the most mysterious ecosystems on Earth.<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/biodiversity-in-the-deep-ocean-faces-unavoidable-threat-from-the-climate-crisis\/"},"Page 23":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/policy-and-economics\">Policy &amp;

How will this impact global fish stocks, and what role does overfishing play in accelerating the reduction of fish populations?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/369\/6499\/65\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>T<\/strong>he study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that the rise in the Earth\u2019s core temperature will have a significant impact on fish stocks worldwide. The researchers investigated whether saltwater or freshwater fish are more sensitive to heat across all climate zones.

The explanation behind such variability lies in the anatomy of the fish during different respective life stages: fish embryos do not have the facilities, such as gills, to allow for greater oxygen intake, and are therefore put at a significant disadvantage when it comes to survival; mating fish require more oxygen to accommodate for the increase in body mass and energy required to successfully reproduce. The strain such requirements have on the fish pose significant health risks that their bodies are essentially unable to manage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the researchers explained that if the rise in temperatures is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/369\/6499\/65\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of fish species would struggle with reproduction, or would be forced to migrate to cooler climates.

Birol highlights five areas where governments can act, including placing clean energy jobs at the centre of stimulus packages, developing and scaling up the next generation of energy technologies to reach net-zero emission targets, and increasing private sector investment into participating in clean energy industries.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the IEA, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iea.org\/news\/world-energy-outlook-2018-examines-future-patterns-of-global-energy-system-at-a-time-of-increasing-uncertainties\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">governments contribute directly and indirectly to around 70% of global energy investments<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Birol argues their leadership is needed to spearhead the transition to clean energy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have two curves we need to quickly bend onto downward trajectories. The curve of coronavirus infections, and the curve of global emissions.\u201d says Birol. \u201cNeither will be easy. But through smart, timely action and cooperation, governments can ensure we achieve both.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) published a report stating that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irena.org\/-\/media\/Files\/IRENA\/Agency\/Publication\/2019\/May\/IRENA_Renewable-Power-Generations-Costs-in-2018.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=99683CDDBC40A729A5F51C20DA7B6C297F794C5D\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">renewable energies have become the lowest-cost source of power generation in most parts of the world<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 with solar and wind technologies leading the way. Francesco La Camera, Director-General of IRENA, says the clean energy sector, which in 2018 employed 11 million people worldwide, can be pivotal in helping rebuild<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">economies. \u201cGovernments can turn to a renewables-based energy transition to bring a range of solutions at this difficult moment. Many renewable technologies can be ramped up relatively quickly, helping to revive industries and create new jobs.\u201d he says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 presents an opportunity for humanity to make a tangible difference in the fight against the climate crisis and lower emissions significantly. Ultimately, as the impacts of the climate crisis become more pertinent, future crises will become more likely. As renewable energy infrastructure becomes ever cheaper to build, the time to transition to clean energy alternatives and commit to combating climate change in the long-term is now.

A report commissioned by the Australian Government\u2019s National Climate Science Advisory Committee, and produced by the Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2020\/mar\/11\/scientists-warn-of-critical-gaps-in-australias-climate-science-capability\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found \u2018critical gaps\u2019 <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the coordination of research into issues such as atmospheric physics concerning heatwaves.

These included the National Energy Guarantee policy, whereby electricity companies were required to meet emission-reduction targets; Morrison abandoned this and committed to reducing public expenditure on energy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2019\/dec\/11\/australia-ranked-worst-of-57-countries-on-climate-change-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">existing emission-cutting initiatives are being abandoned<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; for example, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.climatechangenews.com\/2019\/04\/02\/australia-stops-payments-green-climate-fund\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in 2019, Australia ended its contribution, <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which stands at $187m since 2015, to the UN-established Green Climate Fund, dedicated to cutting emissions in developing countries.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More recently, the Australian Conservation Foundation found that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/australia-news\/2020\/apr\/01\/nearly-one-in-five-of-australias-big-polluters-breach-government-set-emissions-limits?CMP=share_btn_tw\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nearly a fifth <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the most polluting industrial sites in Australia exceeded maximum constraints on greenhouse gas emissions set by the government.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Moreover, the majority of tonnage emitted by these sites was not penalised, meaning the companies were not required to pay a penalty or purchase carbon credits, as is detailed in a \u2018safeguard mechanism\u2019 for cutting carbon emissions implemented by the federal government. This renders this mechanism not fit for purpose.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This desire to avoid <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/2019\/12\/23\/why-australias-prime-minister-just-defended-coal-even-though-country-is-fire-voters-fear-climate-change\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018reckless job-destroying and economy-crunching targets\u2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is understandable; any economic instability caused by deviating from the status quo is naturally less than appealing to voters. However, the Climate Council in Australia, a crowd-funded organisation which gathers facts about the climate crisis, produced a report in 2019 entitled <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.climatecouncil.org.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Costs-of-climate-change-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018Compound costs: How climate change is damaging Australia\u2019s economy\u2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It found that the climate crisis stands to present \u2018substantial systematic economic risks\u2019 to Australia in the long-term. The report detailed that the Australian property market stands to lose $571 billion by 2030 as a result of property damage caused by climate change-driven extreme weather. Other key findings included the fact that, if greenhouse gas emissions remain at current levels, a rise in sea levels by 2100 will mean that $226 billion in infrastructural, commercial and residential assets will be under threat. Morton points out that, although Australia has not formally pulled out of the Paris Agreement, the target set by the Agreement \u2013 that Australia should cut its emissions by 26\u201328% below 2005 levels by 2030 \u2013 is unlikely to be met if Australia continues down its current path.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><strong>How has climate change affected Australia?<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the effects of climate change denial in Australia are being felt beyond dry land. One of Australia\u2019s most defining emblems, the Great Barrier Reef, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2020\/mar\/26\/great-barrier-reefs-latest-bleaching-confirmed-by-marine-park-authority?CMP=share_btn_tw\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has in the past five years endured three mass bleaching episodes, undergoing \u2018very widespread\u2019 damage in the summer of 2019-20. This was attributed to a heat build-up during February.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 2016 and 2017 saw the bleaching and death of approximately 50% of the reef\u2019s shallow water corals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such a track record has not gone unnoticed in the international community. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/world\/2020\/1\/8\/21051756\/australia-fires-climate-change-coal-politics\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Australia was criticised <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at the COP25 2019 UN climate conference in Madrid for its stubbornness regarding the introduction of regulations on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/world\/2020\/1\/8\/21051756\/australia-fires-climate-change-coal-politics\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">international carbon markets<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, in November 2019, a Brown to Green report- a comprehensive evaluation of efforts to address and adapt to the climate crisis across G20 countries- <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2019\/nov\/11\/australia-climate-response-among-worst-g20\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found Australia to be one of the most underprepared countries examined in the report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In particular, the report drew attention to Australia\u2019s rising emissions and the absence of policies to remedy this. The need to address this is becoming ever more urgent. 2019 was Australia\u2019s warmest recorded year, and the country has warmed by just over one degree Celsius since 1910, the bulk of this occurring since 1950, according to the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-australia-51008051\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Bureau of Meteorology<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Australia\u2019s \u2018all-time temperature record\u2019, last set in 2013 at 40.3 degrees Celsius, was broken in December 2019 over two consecutive days, at<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-australia-51008051\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 40.9C and 41.9C respectively.<\/span><\/a><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Climate change denial in Australia, then, demonstrates the dangers of politicising the climate crisis and offering policies geared solely towards propping up the economy in the short-term. With Prime Minister Morrison\u2019s support of the coal industry, his failure to acknowledge the full implications of this summer\u2019s bushfires, and his country\u2019s lack of research into key issues such as\u00a0 heatwaves, it is unsurprising that the crisis has resulted in the deaths of civilians and wildlife, and the devastation of millions of hectares of Australian land. It is now more urgent than ever that our society prioritises facts backed up by rigorous scientific evidence.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Featured image by: <a class=\"owner-name truncate\" data-track=\"attributionNameClick\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/ninian_reid\/49316430338\/in\/photolist-2i8VAzG-5YtmY6-5Y468U-2iy46NX-2iy1Aqz-5YtmXR-5Y468s-5Y468b-2iabSM5-5YtmX6-VPjjyV-24xJzHy-65BU8u-2gxyV2U-2iQdBWv-2hx4yQm-24VviJ3-WQUcme-2ifN6Pb-U5ahvm-2i8VGTD-2fXMHMn-6dZifs-2impTFx-2iczswh-267utMm-G8ySGA-2ifN6JX-2ibRcn3-2hBEP9Y-jYxzCz-2hKgKHi-MLYLDK-5Z5hYw-26M2S6g-5teCCY-2hJL8m8-WjA75N-VA6KcJ-VoH8NJ-2hX2DTy-VNAapC-2h3uVu2-2ikQZ1q-2gxAFDZ-2i5qTWk-W7QbKu-U5ahQj-2gwXo2c-VA6LRf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Go to Ninian Reid's photostream\">Ninian Reid<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/australia-climate-denial\/"},"Page 34":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/biodiversity\">Biodiversity<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/conservation\">Conservation<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">The Florida Panther: Preserving the Peninsula\u2019s Wilderness<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/danielle-gutknecht\/\">Danielle Gutknecht<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <\/span><span>Apr 22nd 2020<\/span><span>5 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"The Florida Panther: Preserving the Peninsula\u2019s Wilderness\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Webp.net-resizeimage-77.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"The Florida Panther: Preserving the Peninsula\u2019s Wilderness\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Webp.net-resizeimage-77.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><b>Veiled by the luscious resorts, vibrant theme parks and crystal-white sands of Florida, an ancient wilderness lives on.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, according to its 2008 Florida Panther Recovery Plan, will consider <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/southeast\/wildlife\/mammals\/florida-panther\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">removing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the Florida panther from the endangered species list once three populations of at least 240 individuals each (excluding dependent-aged kittens) have been established and maintained for at least 12 years and once sufficient habitat has been secured to support them long-term. When compared to smaller populations, panther populations exceeding 240 individuals <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/uploadedFiles\/Panther%20Recovery%20Plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more able to maintain a high level of genetic variability and have the ability to withstand some habitat loss or mild disasters.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many individuals, groups, and organisations working to save the Florida panther. The 26 400-acre <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuge\/Florida_Panther\/about.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, located just over 30km east of Naples, Florida, was established in 1989 to protect Florida panthers and their unique habitats. More recently, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/southeast\/wildlife\/mammals\/florida-panther\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Florida Panther Recovery Implementation Team<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was formed in 2013 with the sole purpose of achieving the goals of the 2008 Florida Panther Recovery Plan. Several dozens of wildlife underpasses, overpasses, high fences and warning signs have been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/animals\/2019\/08\/florida-toll-road-threatens-wildlife-panthers\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">constructed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on roads in Florida\u2019s primary panther habitats to help combat habitat fragmentation and reduce panther mortalities caused by vehicle collisions.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there is still much more to be done. Thomas Hoctor, a landscape ecologist at the University of Florida, cites <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/animals\/2019\/08\/florida-toll-road-threatens-wildlife-panthers\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rising sea levels<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as an imminent threat to the panthers\u2019 current range. In order for the species to survive long-term, Hoctor believes it is crucial for Florida panthers to extend their ranges <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/animals\/2019\/08\/florida-toll-road-threatens-wildlife-panthers\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">northward<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into the millions of acres of territory in northern Florida.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to achieve higher numbers and northward range expansion, wildlife experts may employ a conservation technique similar to one utilised in 1995, in which eight female Texas cougars <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were released in South Florida to breed with Florida panthers. This interbreeding produced a healthier, more resilient generation of panthers, with the panther population in Florida tripling by 2007.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further research, conservation initiatives and public support will be paramount in the ongoing movement to save the Florida panther.

The swarms of bats now outnumber the human population by thousands, creating fear among the town\u2019s inhabitants; bats can cause lyssavirus, a rabies-like disease caused through bites and scratches. The town wants to get rid of the bats, however they are protected under Queensland law.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bats are known to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/bats-immune-system-viruses-ebola-marburg-people\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">carry many diseases<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, such as Ebola, SARS, MERS and the Marburg virus. While the animal acts as a natural reservoir for the illnesses, they do not get infected themselves. This is because the body temperature of the bat is maintained at around 40 degrees Celsius, too high for the viruses to activate. Scientists that have conducted research on the special immunity system of the bat have documented that some species can live up to 40 years, rare for an animal of its size.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because they can fly, bats are found all around the world and are able to adapt to both tropical and temperate climates.

Bats are important pollinators in the tropics; many fruit tree species such as the durian have a specific species of bat as a pollinator. Bats are also an important keystone species that control the population of insects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><strong>The Implications of Climate Change for Bats<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers in Australia are still investigating the unusually large swarms of bats in Ingham.

This causes the usually solitary form of locust, the grasshopper, to develop group behaviour. This process, called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/BF00281928\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018gregarisation\u2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is triggered by the signalling of pheromones from physical contact of each individual grasshopper.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change from solitary to group behaviour usually follows a period of drought and vegetation flushes after periods of rainfall. The locusts reproduce very quickly and a single swarm can span up to 1 200 square kilometres and can contain more than 80 million locusts per square kilometre.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the climate changes, weather patterns have become less predictable. In East Africa, there is usually one cyclone that makes landfall each year but there has been an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/feb\/10\/food-fears-grow-as-swarms-of-locusts-reach-uganda-and-tanzania\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the frequency and intensity of the cyclones in the Indian Ocean. This change in precipitation may lead to more frequent locust invasions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another factor contributing to increasing locust invasions is the reduction of the natural enemies of locusts, such as wasps, birds, reptiles and bats. This is due to deforestation and habitat destruction in East Africa.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, a study in Europe has shown that insect populations have significantly declined by up to 80% in two decades in what is being called an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2019\/nov\/13\/insect-apocalypse-poses-risk-to-all-life-on-earth-conservationists-warn\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018insect apocalypse\u2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The overuse of pesticides and destruction of habitats are the main causes for the reduction in insect numbers. Insects, especially bees, serve a vital ecological function for humans, including pest control and pollination. More diversity of insects means that ecosystems are better able to withstand external pressure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we have entered the Holocene Extinction period, also known as the Anthropocene Extinction period, the number of species becoming extinct due to human activity is predicted to increase. It will eventually reach a tipping point and cause a cascade effect, further disturbing ecosystems and increasing the likelihood of swarms of animals invading regions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/atbaker\/3190753344\/\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Baker<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/how-the-climate-crisis-exacerbates-harmful-swarms-of-animals\/"},"Page 37":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Climate Refugees: When Home Becomes Uninhabitable<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/carla-delgado\/\">Carla Delgado<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <\/span><span>Feb 20th 2020<\/span><span>5 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Climate Refugees: When Home Becomes Uninhabitable\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Earth.Org-Climate-Refugees.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Climate Refugees: When Home Becomes Uninhabitable\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Earth.Org-Climate-Refugees.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>The climate crisis is creating a world of mass displacements due to rising sea levels and swaths of agricultural land rendered useless because of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/site\/assets\/uploads\/2018\/02\/WGIIAR5-PartA_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">erosion, <\/a>land disputes and droughts, among others.

There has always been a trade-off between reducing regional projection uncertainty through higher spatial resolution models and the higher computational costs associated with running these higher resolutions.

These studies determine the extent to which climate change is responsible for certain extreme weather events. This is achieved by comparing the climate model simulations between those with and without inclusion of anthropogenic forcings, or human activity. By comparing the frequency of certain extreme events in both simulations, scientists can quantify how much human activity is shaping the odds of such extreme events happening.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attribution studies have been done on a variety of extreme events, for example <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1748-9326\/aa9ef2\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on the flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey in Texas in 2017<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/ametsoc.net\/eee\/2018\/11_Zhang0202.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on the South China drought in late 2018<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldweatherattribution.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/WWA-Science_France_heat_June_2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on the record-breaking June 2019 heatwave in France<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These studies are useful in estimating the additional economic costs associated with increased frequency of extreme events in a warming climate, which can then be compared to the estimated costs of mitigating and adapting climate change during policy making to see if large investments in policies are justified.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the role that Hong Kong can play in tackling such a global problem, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.policyaddress.gov.hk\/2019\/eng\/pdf\/supplement_7.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">latest HK Policy Address<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> indicates government plans to subsidise the installation of electric vehicle (EV) chargers across private residential buildings, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.energy.gov\/eere\/electricvehicles\/reducing-pollution-electric-vehicles\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">easing pollution<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the dense city.

Thanks to human encroachment and climate change, the forest has been losing almost 16 sq km of vegetation per year since 1991.\u00a0 Earth.Org\u2019s own analysis based on satellite imagery shows that in Bangladesh, home to the largest swath of Sundarbans mangroves, the forest has lost 442 sq km of its vegetation in the last 28 years. 71% of the forested coastline is also retreating by as much as 200 metres a year due to coastline erosion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Containing multiple UNESCO Natural World Heritage sites within itself, the Sundarbans forest is home to a wide variety of plant and animal species. The flora is comprised of a rich mosaic of different types of vegetation; half of all known 110 mangrove species are found within the delta. It is home to over 260 bird species, Indian otters, spotted deer, wild boar, fiddler crabs, mud crabs, three marine lizard species and five marine turtle species dwell in this impervious maze. The forest also hosts endangered species like the estuarine crocodile, Indian python and the iconic Bengal tiger. The mangrove ecosystem plays an indispensable role as breeding and nursery ground coastal fisheries in the Bay of Bengal.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sundarbans is also a natural barrier that protects over 6.5 million people who live in the region from tides and cyclones.

Traditional practices endemic to the region can adapt to periodic ecosystem disruptions, such as rising sea levels or waterlogging. An example includes <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0959652615015279\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a practice in Bangladesh<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of implementing floating cultivation systems that utilise soilless beds made from seaweed. Sustainable and regionally traditional agriculture can significantly increase the market value of commodities. If traditional and sustainable agriculture becomes the norm in the region, the value of commodities will rise and revenue from foreign markets will increase substantially. With more diversified revenue streams, the state can justify the higher cost of implementing renewable energy infrastructure rather than allowing the region to become reliant on fossil fuels.<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/the-worlds-largest-mangrove-forest-is-shrinking\/"},"Page 43":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/solutions\">Solutions<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Climate Crisis: University of Cambridge to Launch a New Centre to Explore Geoengineering and Climate Change<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Sep 9th 2019<\/span><span>3 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Climate Crisis: University of Cambridge to Launch a New Centre to Explore Geoengineering and Climate Change\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/louis-reed-hzp_aT02R48-unsplash-1024x1024-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Climate Crisis: University of Cambridge to Launch a New Centre to Explore Geoengineering and Climate Change\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/louis-reed-hzp_aT02R48-unsplash-1024x1024-1.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><b>It would be the world\u2019s first major research centre dedicated to the task of reversing climate change using geoengineering.<\/b><\/p><p>\u2014<\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of Cambridge is launching a new research centre to explore radical technological solutions including geoengineering to fix climate change.

Certainly, organic agriculture has been proven to indirectly support climate change mitigation. As part of the natural carbon cycle, most of the carbon sequestration occurs when carbon from the atmosphere is absorbed and stored in the soil. Soil from organically managed farms is found to be higher in substances able to capture and store much higher levels of carbon and for longer periods of time.<\/p><p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.soilassociation.org\/media\/4954\/policy_soil_carbon_full_review.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a paper published by the Soil Association<\/a>, organic farming can store an average of 28% higher soil carbon levels in the organic farms in Europe, and around 20% in the organic farms world-wide (source 3). In addition to its climate change mitigation factors, organic agriculture also supports biodiversity through organic farm management practices and increases animal welfare. Avoiding chemical fertilizers and pesticides protects the soil, reduces water pollution and supports human health through fewer concentrations of harmful chemicals, pesticide residues and cadmium in the food.<\/p><p>In addition to these benefits, organic farming also reduces the pollution associated with the use of chemicals on conventional farms.

Over the past few years, you\u2019ve seen a lot of conservative groups pulling their money out of the climate-change-denial industry and putting it instead into efforts by ALEC [the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative lobbying group], for example, to fund legislative efforts blocking clean-energy policies.<\/p><p><strong>The book details the way these fossil fuel interests are working to dampen the public\u2019s enthusiasm for taking action on climate. How are they doing that?<\/strong><\/p><p>I use whole bunch of \u201cD\u201d words to describe this: deflection, delay, division, despair mongering, doomism. To start with, there is an effort to deflect attention away from systemic solutions. They are trying to convince people that climate change is not the result of their corporate policies but of our own individual actions. I mean BP [a multinational oil and gas company headquartered in London] was instrumental in the whole idea of a carbon footprint. They introduced the carbon footprint calculator to help get people to think of this as an individual-responsibility issue.<\/p><p><strong>You mean if people believe that their lifestyle choices are to blame for climate change, they won\u2019t pressure big energy companies to cut their production of fossil fuels or support the development of cleaner alternatives?<\/strong><\/p><p>That\u2019s the idea. One of the best examples of this sort of deflection campaign is the gun lobby\u2019s motto \u201cGuns don\u2019t kill people, people do.\u201d<\/p><p><strong>So that concept has morphed into \u201c<\/strong><strong>Fossil fuels don<\/strong><strong>\u2019t cause climate change, people do\u201d?<\/strong><\/p><p>Exactly. If you can get people arguing over these individual lifestyle choices, then you are creating division over questions such as \u201cAre you vegan or not?\u201d \u201cDo you fly?\u201d So it\u2019s a twofer\u2014you deflect attention away from the need for real policy change, and you get infighting within the climate movement so that climate advocates are not speaking with one coherent voice.<\/p><p><strong>You\u2019re not suggesting that people shouldn\u2019t change their behaviour, are you?<\/strong><\/p><p>We should definitely try to be the best stewards of the planet that we can be. It saves us money, makes us healthier and sets a good example for others. But let\u2019s not allow that to be used as a crutch for the failure to demand larger policy interventions to tackle this problem.

The e-mail suggested that the Green New Deal\u2014supported by white environmentalists\u2014would hurt minority communities.

The long-standing strategy to ensure food security in China has been through self-sufficiency, however, within the past years, the government has struggled to meet the ever-increasing demand through domestic means alone due to limited arable land, water scarcity and soil degradation and contamination. Consequently, the government has become more dependent on agricultural imports over the past several years, adapting its long-standing strategy as well as reshaping the global food system.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><b>Limited Arable Land<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though China has the world\u2019s third-largest landmass, its arable land is very scarce, accounting for only 15.6% of the country.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has been aggravated by the rapid urbanisation and industrialisation that China has experienced in the past several decades; from 1991 to 2014, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oecd-ilibrary.org\/sites\/9789264085299-5-en\/index.html?itemId=\/content\/component\/9789264085299-5-en\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China\u2019s arable land decreased by 15.3%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to the conversion of highly productive agricultural land into urban uses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the increase in population and wealth has put additional stress on the already-limited land due to an increase in food demand and the change from a plant-based diet to an animal-based diet.

Additionally, water resources in China are unevenly geographically distributed, with northern China being one of the most heavily affected regions. This situation can pose a threat, since 56% of the country\u2019s grain production is grown in the north but <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.palgrave.com\/gp\/book\/9789811302350\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it only has access to 16.5% of the national water resources.<\/span><\/a><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The increase in water demand has led to an excessive surface water withdrawals by upstream users.

For this reason, the government\u2019s strategy to moderately increase its food imports to meet its demand can be beneficial, since it can relieve some pressure on its arable land and water resources. However, even though the government of China is addressing its food security threats by adopting several multifaceted policies, such as the Red-Line Policy, the Zero Growth Action Plan and the Returning Grazing Land to Grassland, it should continue to promote more sustainable agricultural practices, improve the productivity of its existing resources and increase its food quality, since its population and urbanisation are expected to grow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/threats-to-food-security-in-china\/"},"Page 5":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/policy-and-economics\">Policy &amp; Economics<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">The Paris Agreement in 2020: Where Are We?<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/tristan-bove\/\">Tristan Bove<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Dec 21st 2020<\/span><span>8 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"The Paris Agreement in 2020: Where Are We?\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/rsz_fridays-for-future-4161573_1280-2.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"The Paris Agreement in 2020: Where Are We?\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/rsz_fridays-for-future-4161573_1280-2.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><b>2020 marks the five-year anniversary of the signing of the Paris Agreement.

Prior to 2020, China\u2019s Paris Agreement goals were widely seen as unambitious and inadequate. However, recent developments and announcements have changed the country\u2019s outlook. The country exists as a unique case within the discussion on global emissions. It is the world\u2019s highest emitter, and a distinct urban\/rural divide, regional inequality and ongoing development in many areas of China mean that the country has yet to reach peak emissions and will continue to invest in coal power over the coming years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these realities, China\u2019s immense financial capacity and desire to be a leader in the tech world has driven the country to invest substantial sums to develop a greener economy.

Before next year\u2019s convention, Russia will need to be pressured to update their intended contributions and establish higher targets. Unilateral action against Russia, such as the EU\u2019s carbon border tax, could play an important role in motivating the country to decouple itself from fossil fuels.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another serious offender that has delayed necessary implementation of ambitious climate policy is the US. As the world\u2019s second-largest contributor to CO2 emissions, a strong climate policy on behalf of the US would be a significant step towards achieving net-zero emissions.

The Paris Agreement appears to have provided the necessary momentum to shift nations\u2019 focus towards low-carbon alternatives, although the lack of a functional policing mechanism may have doomed the more ambitious targets from the start.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mid-century net-zero pledges coming from many countries this year are commendable, although countries will need to be held accountable for their actions over the short term. More ambitious and actionable 2025-2030 targets need to be set and announced over the next year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much will become clearer over the next few months. The delayed climate conference gives major emitters such as the US and China more time to clarify their climate policy. As countries worldwide continue to evaluate how to implement green initiatives in recovery plans, it is probable that more ambitious targets for emission reductions could be made by or at COP26 next November.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/the-paris-agreement-in-2020\/"},"Page 6":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/biodiversity\">Biodiversity<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">The US Plans to Protect Twelve Coral Species in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <\/span><span>Dec 7th 2020<\/span><span>2 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"The US Plans to Protect Twelve Coral Species in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/35462624936_0f09cdbd18_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"The US Plans to Protect Twelve Coral Species in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/35462624936_0f09cdbd18_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>The US has proposed to protect 12 critical coral species in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean, which- if implemented- would protect nearly 16 000 sq km of critical coral habitat.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>C<\/strong>oral reefs are some of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, and they also serve as economic lifelines to millions around the world.

However, more than 60% of irrigated cropland around the world is highly water stressed. Incorrect irrigation can waste water, depleting non-renewable resources such as underground aquifers, and poor management can result in some farmers losing out on water resources \u2013 for example, if rivers and waterways are run dry by upstream irrigation.<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report found that small-scale and farmer-led irrigation systems are often more efficient than large-scale projects. For example, large state-funded schemes in Asia rely on tapping into groundwater, putting pressure on the resource. However, small-scale farmers face difficulties, like a lack of secure water rights and limited access to finance and credit.\u00a0<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In June, the UN urged action to change food production to <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/un-chief-urges-rebuilding-more-resilient-food-systems-post-covid-19\/\" target=\"_blank\">make more resilient food systems<\/a>, but this is no easy task.

And that would make a very big difference, not just to the ecosystem of South Georgia but <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.gs\/fisheries\/overview\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">its economy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He continues, \u201cA close-in iceberg has massive implications for where land-based predators might be able to forage. When you\u2019re talking about penguins and seals during the period that\u2019s really crucial to them \u2013 during pup- and chick-rearing \u2013 the actual distance they have to travel to find food (fish and krill) really matters. If they have to do a big detour, it means they\u2019re not going to get back to their young in time to prevent them starving to death in the interim.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A38 iceberg grounded at South Georgia in 2004, leading to countless dead penguin chicks and seal pups being discovered on local beaches.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the impacts of a potential iceberg-island collision are not all bad, according to Tarling. Icebergs bring with them enormous quantities of dust that will fertilise the ocean plankton around them, and this benefit will then make its way up the food chain.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tarling\u2019s colleague, Dr Andrew Fleming, says, \u201cA68a is spectacular. The idea that it is still in one large piece is actually remarkable, particularly given the huge fractures you see running through it in the radar imagery.

The subject of this article \u2013 the awareness on the part of an individual that climate change is a problem, coupled with a lack of motivation to address or remedy it \u2013 is perhaps a more subtly dangerous cousin of pure climate change denialism: climate inactivism.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>T<\/strong>he key difference between these two types of inactivism lies in belief in the science surrounding climate change. Pure climate change denialism is motivated by a disbelief in, or an unwillingness to engage with or acknowledge, the facts reinforcing the existence of climate change. Meanwhile, the latter kind involves the individual being aware of the existence and severity of climate change, but being unwilling to address the problem. This could be due to the individual seeing climate change as too removed from their personal circumstances, or as too large or costly a problem to remedy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, human psychology and how people behave in threatening situations appears to be at odds with climate change inactivism. If we encounter a potentially threatening situation, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2018\/10\/why-people-arent-motivated-to-address-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we tend to explore all possible means of avoiding it;<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for example, if we see a car travelling towards us at speed while we cross the road, we will naturally endeavour to move out of its way. According to this logic, then, climate change \u2013 one of the most fundamental threats to human lives and existence \u2013 should provoke a similar response amongst the populations and governments of the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/nearly-50-himalaya-lakes-are-at-risk-of-breaching-report\/\" target=\"_blank\">Nearly 50 Himalaya Lakes Are at Risk of Breaching- Report<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is clearly something else at play, however, when one examines certain case studies.

Is this a case of pure climate change denialism, or something more complicated?<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Donald Trump\u2019s case, it is more likely that he is simply catering to the mood of his voters. A 2019 survey found that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/climatecommunication.yale.edu\/publications\/americans-underestimate-how-many-others-in-the-u-s-think-global-warming-is-happening\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approximately 31%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Americans did not believe climate change was real or a threat, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/environment\/uk-climate-change-real-accept-majority-global-warming-poll-finds-a7909841.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compared with approximately 13% of Brits<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from the results of a separate 2017 survey.

However, this does not necessarily translate into direct action on the part of American individuals, whatever their beliefs about the climate crisis are.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contradiction between what is expected behaviour in humans in threatening situations, and what occurs in reality, can be explained by another fundamental aspect of human psychology: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/qje\/article-abstract\/107\/2\/573\/1838331?redirectedFrom=fulltext\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">temporal discounting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which finds that humans place higher importance on short-term benefits than on long-term benefits. In other words, the long-term benefits of slowing or reversing the process of climate change are, to most individuals, not worth the considerable sacrifices which would need to be made in the short term to daily life in order to achieve this.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is in the best interests not only of individuals, but also of governments and businesses to refrain from taking an active role in combating the climate crisis, chiefly due to the expenses involved in the short term. It is becoming <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/ignoring-the-climate-crisis-cost-global-economy-792-tn\/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20new%20analysis,cut%20down%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increasingly apparent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the cost of ignoring the climate crisis could be far worse than any short-term losses \u2013 according to a 2020 article in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-020-15453-z\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nature Communications<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the global economy would lose between US$150-792 trillion by 2100 should countries fail to meet their current targets to cut emissions.

Despite this, the compulsion to value short-term benefits over those in the long term means that, while the climate crisis accelerates, governments are stalling.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/buy\/2010-06891-005\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">construal level theory<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> posits that an individual will not relate as personally to an issue that does not directly affect them, than to one that has a significant impact on their daily life. While many people across the world are indeed directly affected by the climate crisis, the majority of the world\u2019s population does not suffer, for example, from the consequences of extreme weather conditions on a regular basis. The direct impacts of the climate crisis, therefore, are more removed in the minds of most individuals from their personal situation. As a result, although the individual may understand that such problems as extreme weather conditions and drought arise from the climate crisis, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2018\/10\/why-people-arent-motivated-to-address-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they are less likely to take direct action.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, waiting until everybody in the world is directly affected by the more extreme effects of the climate crisis is not a viable scenario. Markman (2018) <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2018\/10\/why-people-arent-motivated-to-address-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">suggests<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that a potential solution to the problem of construal level theory in relation to the climate crisis is \u201cbringing the future mentally close, so you begin to feel the specifics of a daily life disrupted by a change in global climate,\u201d in order to \u201chelp reduce the psychological distance\u201d between the individual and the climate crisis. He also promotes the idea of self-education, suggesting that familiarising oneself with the science and key climate legislation and predictions, such as the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/sr15\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UN Special Report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from 2018, is an important step.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the psychological barriers preventing direct action to combat climate change on the part of individuals and governments alike, a methodical and specific approach to self-education and planning for the future could be the answer to reducing this particular kind of climate change inactivism.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-inactivism-why-arent-people-more-motivated-to-address-the-climate-crisis\/"},"Page 11":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Vietnam is Battling its Worst Floods in Decades<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <\/span><span>Oct 21st 2020<\/span><span>2 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Vietnam is Battling its Worst Floods in Decades\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/6829452732_b565ee9408_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Vietnam is Battling its Worst Floods in Decades\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/6829452732_b565ee9408_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>At least five million people in central Vietnam are facing disaster as the country battles its worst floods in decades.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>S<\/strong>o far, flooding and landslides in October have killed over 100 people, and left dozens more missing.

In 2017 and 2018, US insurers paid out almost <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sacbee.com\/news\/politics-government\/capitol-alert\/article234161407.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USD$25 billion in claims<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; after the Camp fire in 2018, the losses were so high that it forced a small insurance company out of business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To reduce the chances of receiving a nonrenewal notice, according to experts, homeowners in high-risk areas should talk to their insurance agent about how to make their homes more resilient. This could include altering landscaping, securing loose items and clearing debris. More worryingly, homeowners in high-risk areas may have to move or prepare for a new reality. <\/span>This problem will certainly not be unique to the US as the planet continues to warm. It is imperative that we stop emitting greenhouse gases or at the very least mitigate the effects that natural disasters could have on homes to reduce the amount of climate migrants who have to move elsewhere.<\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/us-homes-insurance-climate-crisis\/"},"Page 14":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/energy\">Energy<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Your Search Engine\u2019s Secret: The Billions of Gallons of Water a Year Needed to Power the Internet<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/nicole-kempis\/\">Nicole Kempis<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Sep 29th 2020<\/span><span>3 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Your Search Engine\u2019s Secret: The Billions of Gallons of Water a Year Needed to Power the Internet\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Webp.net-resizeimage.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Your Search Engine\u2019s Secret: The Billions of Gallons of Water a Year Needed to Power the Internet\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Webp.net-resizeimage.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>How many gigabytes of data do you consume every month?

The fire-impacted regions included critical habitat for 832 species of native vertebrate fauna, including 378 birds, 254 reptiles, 102 frogs, 83 mammals and 15 freshwater fish, according to the study.<\/p><p>\u201cThis figure doesn\u2019t include invertebrates or plants, so while a huge amount of species, severely underplays the impact of just one fire event,\u201d lead author Michelle Ward, a researcher at the University of Queensland, told Mongabay in an email.<\/p><p>According to the study, 70 species had more than 30% of their habitat burned, with some species losing more than 80% of their natural territory. Of these 70 species, 21 are already threatened with extinction, including the Kangaroo Island dunnart (<em>Sminthopsis aitkeni<\/em>) and long-footed potoroo (<em>Potorous longipes<\/em>), both mouse-sized marsupials.<\/p><p>Ward and her colleagues say the bushfires likely caused a 14% increase in the number of threatened species, and have called for an urgent assessment of these species via Australia\u2019s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act, a piece of legislation that classifies threatened species and subspecies, and provides a legal framework for their protection.<\/p><p>Species not currently listed as threatened, but that may need assessment under the EPBC Act, include Kate\u2019s leaf-tailed gecko (<em>Saltuarius kateae<\/em>), the short-eared possum (<em>Trichosurus caninus<\/em>), and Littlejohn\u2019s tree frog (<em>Litoria littlejohni<\/em>), the study suggests.<\/p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that many of the animals impacted by these fires were already declining in numbers because of habitat destruction, drought, disease, and invasive species,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThese fires are just another nail in the coffin for many of our native species.\u201d<\/p><p>Ward said some independent and government-funded surveys are already underway, but the process of getting listings updated via the EPBC Act can be a lengthy process, sometimes taking more than two years. However, Ward says she and her team have been in \u201cconstant communication\u201d with the government of Australia about the impact of the bushfires.<\/p><p>A spokesperson for the Australian government\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment told Mongabay it has established the\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"http:\/\/www.environment.gov.au\/biodiversity\/bushfire-recovery\/expert-panel\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wildlife and threatened species bushfire recovery Expert Panel<\/a>\u00a0to help guide recovery actions for native species impacted by the fires, and it was already engaging with the\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.environment.gov.au\/biodiversity\/threatened\/tssc\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Threatened Species Scientific Committee<\/a>, which is responsible for amending and updating lists of threatened species. Additionally, the government said it had invested $200 million to support bushfire recovery for native wildlife and their habitat.<\/p><p>\u201cThe bushfires have had a significant impact on native plants and animals, and it is likely that species which were not previously considered threatened with extinction are now at risk as a result of the fires, while other species, which were previously considered threatened, are likely to now be at greater risk of extinction,\u201d the spokesperson said.<\/p><p>Another team of researchers recently released an interim\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wwf.org.au\/news\/news\/2020\/3-billion-animals-impacted-by-australia-bushfire-crisis#gs.cur2d6\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report<\/a>, stating that nearly 3 billion animals had died in the fires, including\u00a0 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs. These numbers are much higher than previous estimates of 1 billion animals dying in the fires.<\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/worst-wildfires-in-us-history\/\" target=\"_blank\">13 Worst Wildfires in US History<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>\u201cIt is quite likely the fires would have caused some extinctions, but we won\u2019t know until after the surveys,\u201d Ward said.<\/p><p>The EPBC Act currently\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.environment.gov.au\/cgi-bin\/sprat\/public\/publicthreatenedlist.pl\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lists<\/a>\u00a0202 faunal species as threatened, 164 as endangered, and 89 as critically endangered. Fifty-five faunal species are already listed as extinct.<\/p><p>Ward says native species may need a \u201crange of strategic post-fire management actions to maintain and recover their populations\u201d following the bushfires, including invasive species management and captive-breeding programs. It\u2019s also important to protect fire-burned areas from salvage logging and other destructive activities that can disrupt an ecosystem\u2019s ability to recover, she said.<\/p><p>With the next bushfire season right around the corner, study co-author James Watson, director of the science and research initiative at the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and professor at the University of Queensland\u2019s School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, said it\u2019s important to learn how to better manage forests to reduce fire risk and protect threatened species.<\/p><p>\u201cWhile fire is a crucial aspect of many ecosystems, we\u2019re witnessing climate change-induced drought combined with land use management practices that make forests more fire prone,\u201d Watson said in a statement. \u201cWe need to learn from these events as they are likely to happen again.\u201d<\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a

A recent example of this is when thousands of spectacled flying foxes <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nrdc.org\/onearth\/heat-wave-australia-killed-23000-spectacled-flying-foxes\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">suddenly dropped dead during the November 2018 Australian heatwave<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bom.gov.au\/climate\/updates\/articles\/a032.shtml\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">temperatures peaked at 49.3\u00b0C<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Western Australia.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flying foxes are among the largest species of bats in the world, with a wingspan of around 1 to 1.5 metres.

At the time, this was estimated to be nearly a third of the total population of the species and as a result of this, the Australian government changed the status of the flying foxes <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.environment.gov.au\/cgi-bin\/sprat\/public\/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=185\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from vulnerable to endangered<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is not just freak incidents and sharp, sudden increases in temperature that are placing animals at risk. The Earth is gradually warming up as a whole, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.giss.nasa.gov\/research\/news\/20190523\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scientists have estimated<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that average global temperatures have increased by around 1\u00b0C since 1880. While this number may seem miniscule, this is a global average, and different areas and habitats are warming at different rates. For example, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nsidc.org\/cryosphere\/arctic-meteorology\/climate_change.html#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%2030%20years,climate%20change%20in%20the%20Arctic.\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Arctic has warmed nearly twice as fast<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as the rest of the world, a phenomenon that scientists have described as \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0921818111000397\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arctic amplification<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/pnas\/early\/2019\/01\/04\/1808838115.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another habitat at risk is the ocean<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which due to the higher specific heat capacity of water, has absorbed around 90% of all of the heat gained by the planet from 1971 \u2013 2010.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smaller increases in temperature can still prove harmful to some animals. An example of this are corals, which form the backbone of reef ecosystems and are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coralguardian.org\/en\/coral-reef-important\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">estimated<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to shelter 25% of all marine species.

This causes the \u201cbleaching\u201d as the coral loses its colour from the absence of the algae. Deprived of nutrients, the coral eventually dies. Bleached corals can eventually recover if conditions return to normal and the algae return to them, but are at greater risk of mortality until they do so.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While other factors such as water salinity, light levels and even colder waters can cause coral bleaching, these factors mostly cause localised coral bleaching.

Krill are small crustaceans that are an important food source for many aquatic animals, especially in Arctic environments. Aside from this, they are also used in commercial fishing as a food source for fish farms. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pri.org\/stories\/2015-07-14\/scientists-consider-whether-krill-need-be-protected-human-over-hunting\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Krill could be considered the most abundant species on Earth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but climate change could be affecting their population sizes, which holds severe implications for the food chain.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most studies have focused on how habitat loss has affected krill populations, particularly the shrinking of ice caps which shelter the krill during winter. However, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fmars.2020.00501\/full\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent research<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has shown that heat stress has been affecting the hatch rates and success of krill, which affects the sustainability of krill populations in the face of global warming. Hatching occurs best at lower temperatures, at around -1.5\u00b0C, as the krill have evolved to hatch specifically in arctic environments. Hatching at higher temperatures, while possible, results in greater mortality. Similarly, growth rates peak at around 0.5\u00b0C, reducing to zero growth at around 3\u00b0C, demonstrating just how sensitive the growth rates are to small changes in temperature.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continued global temperature increases, regardless of how minute they are, could cause huge disturbances to ecosystems.

Furthermore, habitat loss is likely to increase the vulnerability of animals to heat stress. For example, deforestation and land use changes could lead to a loss of shaded areas or watering holes which animals use to cool off.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps a more immediate and practical way to make a difference is by identifying species that are particularly vulnerable to heat stress and offer some degree of mitigation or protection.

It disproportionately affects Black and brown people in part due to the high frequency of pre-existing conditions like asthma and high blood pressure. These can stem from decades of toxic pollution being dumped in communities of color and which place people at higher risk of complications. Meanwhile, there is the continuing crisis of systemic racism in America that people of color have known and experienced for generations. All of these things intersect, and we must center the fight for environmental justice in the broader conversation.\u201d<\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/sponge-cities-could-be-the-answer-to-impending-water-crisis-in-china\/\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018Sponge Cities\u2019 Could Be The Answer to China\u2019s Impending Water Crisis<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Harris\u2019 commitment to this kind of work dates back to her days as a district attorney.

While an \u201codd pangolin\u201d might reside in some northern parts of the province, he told Mongabay, the population as a whole is not viable.<\/p><p>The loss of the species in the KwaZulu-Natal is mainly due to pangolin poaching and trafficking, although Temminck\u2019s pangolins are also commonly electrocuted by the fences separating parks, nature reserves and private properties.<\/p><p>For the last 10 years, the team at the African Pangolin Working Group (APWG) have been rescuing pangolins from the trade, and rehabilitating them so they can eventually be released back into the wild in South Africa. But it was only in 2019 that the team started reintroducing pangolins into the KwaZulu-Natal province, where they\u2019ve been ecologically extinct.<\/p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all pretty much in a very bad way when they come out of the trade,\u201d said Jansen, who chairs the APWG. \u201cThey don\u2019t feed in captivity, so they\u2019re generally quite emaciated and dehydrated and extremely stressed.\u201d<\/p><p>The first stop for these rescued pangolins is\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"http:\/\/www.johannesburgwildlifevet.com\/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Johannesburg Wildlife Veterinary Hospital<\/a>, a nonprofit facility that only treats wildlife. In most cases, the pangolins need antibiotics to help ward off illnesses that they picked up while being trafficked, Jansen said. If they survive this process, they\u2019re placed in what he calls a \u201csoft release\u201d program.<\/p><p>\u201cWe found that this soft facilitated release is far more successful than simply opening a cage door and letting the animal go,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it with other wildlife as well. When you transport and transpose other animals like lions and buffaloes and elephants, you first need to put them into a\u00a0<em>boma<\/em>\u00a0[corral] firstly to feed them there for a couple of weeks, get them accustomed to the habitat, the food, the environment, the sights, the sounds. Pangolins are no different.\u201d<\/p><p>During the soft release period, caretakers will take the pangolins for long walks in the reserve to ensure they can find enough ants and termites to eat, then take them back to a secure shelter to sleep.<\/p><p>\u201cWe have to go and physically walk behind them for anywhere from four to seven hours every single evening so that they can forage,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cIt requires a huge amount of effort and manpower.\u201d<\/p><p>The soft release program may only take days or up to three weeks, depending on the animal\u2019s ability to adapt to its surroundings, Jansen said. When they\u2019re eventually released, caretakers continue to observe them through GPS satellite-based and VHF radio-based tracking tags.

Phinda was an ideal release site because of its large size and the \u201cgood team on the ground,\u201d Jansen said.<\/p><p>\u201cOut of the seven we\u2019ve released on Phinda, one individual got a very large tick infection and got biliary and died, and another individual \u2026 swam across a large river then was taken by a crocodile,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cBut these are natural deaths that aren\u2019t related to the trade.\u201d<\/p><p>The other five pangolins are \u201cdoing well,\u201d Simon Naylor, manager of the Phinda Private Game Reserve, told Mongabay.<\/p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve found food, they\u2019ve found burrows, and they\u2019ve survived the full 12 months of summer and winter, and they\u2019re still here \u2026 and this is a success,\u201d Naylor said. However, he added that the ultimate measure of success would be when the pangolins started to reproduce.<\/p><p>One of the five pangolins is a young male named Rampfy who was picked up on the side of the road near Kruger National Park in 2018, and hand-raised by a number of individuals.<\/p><p>\u201cThis little male is quite special,\u201d Naylor said. \u201cNo [Temminck\u2019s] pangolin has ever been hand-raised and released back into the wild, and he\u2019s been out in the wild since November and doing very well. I think it just shows that with a lot of efforts, we can successfully hand-raise and release these animals, and give them a second chance.\u201d<\/p><p>There are plans to reintroduce more pangolins into the Phinda Private Game Reserve, Naylor said. In fact, they\u2019re expecting another pangolin to arrive shortly.<\/p><p>\u201cI think this is a very special project, and no one knew how it would turn out,\u201d Naylor said. \u201cThey\u2019re very stressed animals when they arrive here, and it\u2019s been a lot of hard work \u2026 very late nights, long hours. We\u2019ve put a lot of funding towards it, with the monitoring, especially. But I think for the species, it bodes well \u2014\u00a0we\u2019ve managed to show that we can successfully reintroduce these animals.\u201d<\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2020\/06\/its-a-success-pangolins-return-to-a-region-where-they-were-once-extinct\/\" target=\"_blank\">Francois Meyer for Mongabay<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>This article was <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2020\/06\/its-a-success-pangolins-return-to-a-region-where-they-were-once-extinct\/\" target=\"_blank\">originally published on Mongabay<\/a>, written by Elizabeth Claire Alberts , and is republished here as part of an editorial partnership with Earth.Org.\u00a0<\/em><\/em><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/pangolins-return-to-a-region-where-they-were-once-extinct\/"},"Page 22":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Climate Conundrum: Could COVID-19 Be Linked to Early Arctic Ice Melt?<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/mongabay\/\">Mongabay<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Jul 22nd 2020<\/span><span>7 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Climate Conundrum: Could COVID-19 Be Linked to Early Arctic Ice Melt?\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/4684077456_31d7b4ec1f_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Climate Conundrum: Could COVID-19 Be Linked to Early Arctic Ice Melt?\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/4684077456_31d7b4ec1f_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>In mid-May, a pocket of scorching hot air flowed north from Siberia and fanned out across the Arctic Ocean reaching as far as Greenland and triggering an\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/weather\/2020\/05\/15\/arctic-heat-wave-breaks-records\/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unprecedented heatwave<\/a>.

To put that in perspective, greenhouse gases are responsible for warming of about 4 watts per meter squared. When Diamond and his team calculated the global cooling effect from all industrial activity around the world, on land and at sea, they found that sulphate aerosol-seeded clouds masked about a third of all warming from greenhouse gases.<\/p> <img alt=\"covid-19 arctic ice melt\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-16604 size-full\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/arctis-sea-at-sunset.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/arctis-sea-at-sunset.jpg 800w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/arctis-sea-at-sunset-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/arctis-sea-at-sunset-768x510.jpg 768w\" height=\"531\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20531'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"800\"><noscript><img alt=\"covid-19 arctic ice melt\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-16604 size-full\" height=\"531\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/arctis-sea-at-sunset.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/arctis-sea-at-sunset.jpg 800w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/arctis-sea-at-sunset-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/arctis-sea-at-sunset-768x510.jpg 768w\" width=\"800\"\/><\/noscript><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><figcaption><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As sunlight intensifies in the Arctic during the spring and summer, clouds matter; the fewer the clouds, the more sunshine, and the more melt (Source: <a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/visualhunt.com\/re7\/32c32a98\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VisualHunt).<\/a><\/span><br\/> <\/span><\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>And Then Came COVID-19<\/strong><\/p><p>Researchers around the world are now trying to parse out how Coronavirus lockdown measures have affected global emissions.

The higher the albedo value, the more white a surface is- conversely, the lower the albedo value, the more dark or black a surface is.

Firstly, ethnic minorities have a higher chance of spreading and getting infected by the virus as they are more likely to live in urban, overcrowded, and\/or deprived areas, and have jobs, such as in retail and manual labour that cannot be moved online, that put them at a higher risk. Secondly, they are also at risk of poorer outcomes after acquiring the infection due to higher chances of pre-existing health conditions in certain groups.

In this sense, what we consider to be a healthy environment now, past generations would consider to be degraded, and what we judge to be degraded now, the next generation will consider to be healthy or \u2018normal\u2019. As Soga and Gaston (2018) argue, without memory, knowledge, or experience of past environmental conditions, current generations cannot perceive how much their environment has changed because they are comparing it to their own \u2018normal\u2019 baseline and not to historical baselines.<\/span><\/p><p><strong>Evidence for Shifting Baseline Syndrome in Conservation<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Shifting Baseline Syndrome is acknowledged by environmental scientists, particularly by conservationists, there is little research to support its existence that is beyond anecdotal, yet this evidence occurs globally; for example, in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0006320708000190\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eastern Indonesia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where biodiversity has declined rapidly over 30 years, younger fishers were found to recall a lower abundance of wildlife in the past, meaning they were perceiving less of a decline in the wildlife population, compared to older fishers. Similarly, in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0959378015000187\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolivian Amazonia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it was found that younger generations perceived the number of locally-extinct tree and fish species as lower compared to older generations. Again, a study in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00267-008-9152-0\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Seward Peninsula in Alaska, US<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A, an area that is facing rapid hydrological environmental change as a result of climate change, found that younger people were less aware of changes in the quality and availability of five local water resources. While these studies are not directly about SBS, they have each recorded a difference in how older and younger generations perceive environmental change locally, which draws back to Soga and Gaston\u2019s framework, which emphasises the importance of differences in memory, knowledge, and experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/un-chief-urges-rebuilding-more-resilient-food-systems-post-covid-19\/\" target=\"_blank\">UN Chief Urges Action For Rebuilding More Resilient Food Systems<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the lack of empirical evidence, Shifting Baseline Syndrome is being given attention, perhaps because it has implications for individuals and environmental policy in fighting against climate change.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On an individual level, SBS has increased our tolerance to environmental degradation, including wildlife population decline, increased pollution and loss of natural habitats. This is because people will evaluate the severity of environmental degradation by referencing it back to their own cognitive baseline. In the UK, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/oceana.org\/blog\/daniel-pauly-and-george-monbiot-conversation-about-shifting-baselines-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">George Monbiot <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">summarises the state of conservation, saying, \u201cconservation in this country has become indistinguishable from destruction because what we\u2019re conserving is an ecocidal system of sheep ranching. Sheep eat everything, and as a result, there\u2019s no birds, no insects. We\u2019ve lost almost everything, and yet we regard that as normal and natural.\u201d In the UK people are actively conserving ecologically desolate ecosystems as they have no reference to past British wilderness.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a societal level, this unawareness of past environmental conditions or current rates of degradation has implications for policymakers. For example, in the UK, the Environment Act of 1995 (the original legislation for National Parks was introduced in 1949) revised the legislation stating the statutory purpose for National Parks. Their main goal is to \u2018<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalparks.uk\/students\/whatisanationalpark\/aimsandpurposesofnationalparks\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage\u2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Those who introduced this legislation originally had a perception of \u2018natural beauty, wildlife, and cultural heritage\u2019, and so current National Park conservation practise is driven by a static perception, despite itself studying a subject of constant dynamism. When National Parks were originally established they were characterised by traditional agriculture. While this may seem insignificant the inclusion of \u2018cultural heritage\u2019 protects agriculture as part of the landscape, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0016328709000597\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">despite its environmental impact.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Therefore the conservation approach in these areas can be described as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecos.org.uk\/admitting-defeat-why-i-am-quitting-nature-conservation\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unambitious<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as they maintain what is simply there or set targets <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0025326X17300115\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that are not inclusive of historical data<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and trends. However, people are satisfied because the landscape looks the same as when the legislation was introduced.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, our conservation and policy efforts are becoming less effective with each generation, while we become more satisfied with our diminishing actions because our targets are weaker in terms of biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity. The result is a feedback loop, where every generation\u2019s increasing tolerance for environmental decline results in insufficient conservation efforts that inevitably cannot forestall degradation which next generations will tolerate because they have no preconception of the state of the environment.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the \u2018doom and gloom\u2019, Soga and Gaston have designed theoretical response frameworks that could help mitigate the effects of SBS. They argue that solutions to minimise the impact of SBS lie in environmental restoration, increased data collection, reducing the \u2018extinction of experience\u2019 (the decline of people interacting with nature) and education.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Environmental restoration, mainly in the form of rewilding, will be able to demonstrate historical baselines to those who are potentially affected by SBS. Data collection will help to better inform current and future generations how the environment is changing and has changed from past conditions. Soga and Gaston suggest that<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.org\/encyclopedia\/citizen-science\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> citizen science <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">could play a huge role in creating \u2018large-scale, long-term data sets\u2019 as well as increasing people\u2019s interactions with nature to reduce this extinction of experience. In addition to this, reducing the extinction of experience through the promotion of positive experiences with nature will help to increase interaction with the environment. Finally, education will help individuals to better assess the state of the environment and to accurately communicate its past and present condition.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, even while we wait for the scientific study of Shifting Baseline Syndrome to begin, the acknowledgement of this concept in environmental science means that leaders in the field could take steps to help mitigate its potential effects. Soga and Gatson\u2019s solutions, specifically rewilding and education, could increase people\u2019s interactions with nature and promote the importance of effective conservation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/shifting-baseline-syndrome\/"},"Page 27":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">How COVID-19 Could Ruin Weather Forecasting and Climate Records<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/jiahui-qiu\/\">Jiahui Qiu<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <\/span><span>Jun 11th 2020<\/span><span>5 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"How COVID-19 Could Ruin Weather Forecasting and Climate Records\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/1024px-Visualization_of_the_GPM_Core_Observatory_and_Partner_Satellites.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"How COVID-19 Could Ruin Weather Forecasting and Climate Records\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/1024px-Visualization_of_the_GPM_Core_Observatory_and_Partner_Satellites.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>In the midst of lockdowns and social distancing measures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world seems to have come to a near-standstill. Yet it\u2019s business as usual for our weather and climate, and the meteorological services that we normally take for granted are struggling to keep up. The impact of COVID-19 on climate and weather records operations could threaten the accuracy of future forecasts as well as cause looming gaps in long-term data collection.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>T<\/strong>hough a large proportion of data collection for weather and climate forecasting services is carried out by satellites and autonomous weather stations, much of this work requires human intervention, including maintenance work, which is now often not possible because of the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Scientists such as those at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California often conduct research on commercial container ships, allowing them to measure ocean currents and other properties of the weather at sea.

Justine Parks, who manages one of the programs at Scripps, remarked that she has never witnessed the entire programme shut down for this long. Similarly, for the Ocean Observatories Initiative, based in Oregon State University, sensors that are located at sea are also out of reach, and the delay in maintaining these instruments may cause them to degrade over time.

Usually, sensors on board thousands of commercial aircraft transmit data to the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) program, allowing it to generate high-quality observations on temperature, wind, etc., together with positional information. The number of meteorological measurements taken from aircraft has decreased by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/media\/press-release\/covid-19-impacts-observing-system\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">75-80%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> compared to normal, while areas in the global south are experiencing a decline of up to 90%.

Some also maintain long-term records of our climate. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Paris-based Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) have both been recording long-term data on ocean health and climate change. Due to fewer shipboard observations, the IOC has estimated a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-020-00924-6\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">15% decrease<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the number of stations at sea transmitting data. This number is likely to grow as travel restrictions remain. Other projects, however, are hopeful of pulling through. The Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment has stations situated in coastal and mountainous areas all over the world, most of which are autonomous \u2014 only maintained by one or two staff members onsite. The vast network is expected to remain stable even if an instrument or site breaks down. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the US (NOAA) reports that fewer than 5% of its sites have lost data as of late April.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the unprecedented impact of COVID-19, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">national meteorological and hydrological services of countries around the world are <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rising to the challenge, not only to keep up with normal operations of climate and weather forecasting services, but also to assist in the global response to the pandemic. They have offered up their supercomputers, instruments and scientific models to help researchers find out how environmental factors, such as humidity and temperature, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/media\/press-release\/covid-19-impacts-observing-system\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">could affect the spread of the virus<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Meanwhile, they still have to provide clear and accurate warnings of weather-related hazards such as cyclones and heatwaves to local emergency services, a task made more complicated by social distancing. This is especially true for areas affected by the Pacific hurricane season, which begins in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhc.noaa.gov\/archive\/2020\/ep01\/ep012020.discus.001.shtml\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">late April<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and generally lasts till November.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As in many other workplaces, these agencies usually have people working in close quarters, and have had to adapt to different practices in order to protect the health of their staff. In response to the loss of meteorological data from commercial aircraft, some countries are deploying more radiosondes, especially in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/media\/press-release\/covid-19-impacts-observing-system\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Europe<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Radiosondes are telemetry instruments, each typically weighing about as much as a hamster, which can collect and transmit data such as temperature, humidity and pressure. Luckily, meteorological and research satellites remain fully operational and unaffected, providing a stable source of automated observations. Most recently, the European Space Agency has begun to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eumetsat.int\/website\/home\/News\/DAT_5002251.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">distribute wind data <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from its Aeolus satellite to the entire international meteorological community.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/media\/press-release\/covid-19-impacts-observing-system\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has expressed concern<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the disruptions to these essential services. The WMO is a UN-backed specialised agency that oversees the coordination and exchange of weather and climate data between its 193 international Member States and Territories. Its Global Observing System provides the framework for the sharing and integration of data coming from various sources around the world, allowing for analyses, forecasts, warnings and advisories to be issued to local communities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, says, \u201cThe impacts of climate change and growing amount of weather-related disasters continue, as we have seen with Tropical Cyclone Harold in the Pacific, and the floods in East Africa. As we approach the Atlantic hurricane season, the COVID-19 pandemic poses an additional challenge, and may exacerbate multi-hazard risks at a single country level. Therefore it is essential that governments pay attention to their national early warning and weather observing capabilities.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The precise extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the world\u2019s climate and weather services will probably not be well understood until after recovery but the importance of having resilient observing systems has been made abundantly clear. The hard work of researchers and the wide variety of meteorological data sources has allowed many agencies and programs to continue providing vital, prompt information to communities vulnerable to weather hazards, as well as maintain climate records.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Visualization_of_the_GPM_Core_Observatory_and_Partner_Satellites.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">NASA<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/covid-19-could-ruin-weather-forecasting-and-climate-records\/"},"Page 28":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Game changer?

There are two genotypes of beans that show different sensitivity to ozone. Dr. Felix Leung and his team found that the ozone-sensitive genotype bean suffered higher ozone-induced foliar damage, with more red mottles and a higher death rate. This shows that ozone level in Hong Kong is high enough to cause significant damage to plants even in the countryside.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Amos Tai from the Faculty of Science says, \u201cthe data obtained from this garden is essential to not only demonstrate the impacts of air pollution on plants under locally specific environmental conditions, but can also be used to derive important parameters of ecophysiology and biometeorology that can be used to build a regionally relevant earth system model for predictive purposes. Such an ozone garden has also been shown to provide great opportunities for public education. The differences in visual damage on ozone-sensitive, normal and ozone-tolerant plants are often striking, and can be used in publicity and educational events to raise awareness of pollution impacts on life and to galvanize corresponding technical and policy solutions to protect regional ecosystems and agriculture against pollution threats.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To specifically tackle ozone pollution, the governments of Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macau have committed to a 3-year joint study from 2020-2023 to better understand the origins of ozone precursors, its formation and its transportation.

Additionally, more ozone-tolerant trees should be planted along the roadside to improve air quality.

However, this range is shifting and shrinking as a result of anthropogenic climate change, which is dropping more and more people into what the paper describes as \u2018near unliveable\u2019 extremes.<\/p><p>The researchers say that they are shocked at how sensitive humanity is, because we are concentrated on land- which is warming faster than the oceans- and because most future population growth will be in already hot regions of Asia and Africa. Because of these demographic factors, the average human will experience a temperature increase of 7.5\u00b0C when global temperatures reach 3\u00b0C warming.<\/p><p>At this temperature, about a third of the world\u2019s population would live in average temperatures of 29\u00b0C, conditions that are rare outside of the most scorched part of the Sahara, but with global heating of 3\u00b0C, this is expected to be the norm for 1.2 billion people in India, 485 million people in Nigeria and more than 100 million in each of Pakistan, Indonesia and Sudan. This would create hundreds of millions more climate refugees and pose challenges to food production systems.

We think of ourselves as very adaptable because we use clothes, heating and air conditioning. But, in fact, the vast majority of people live- and have always lived- inside a climate niche that is now moving as never before. There will be more change in the next 50 years than in the past 6 000 years.\u201d<\/p><p>The authors hope that their findings spur policymakers to accelerate emission cuts and work together to cope with migration.<\/p><p>In late 2018, the UN World Meteorological Organization <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-climate-change-un\/global-temperatures-on-track-for-3-5-degree-rise-by-2100-u-n-idUSKCN1NY186\" target=\"_blank\">warned<\/a> that global temperatures are on course for a 3-5\u00b0C rise this century, far overshooting the Paris Agreement target of limiting this increase to 2\u00b0C or less by 2100.<\/p><p>According to estimates from over 70 peer-reviewed studies, <a href=\"https:\/\/interactive.carbonbrief.org\/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees\/\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon Brief<\/a> paints a grim picture of the world under 2\u00b0C, 3\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C temperature rise this century:<\/p><p>At two degrees, the melting of ice sheets will pass a tipping point of collapse, triggering flooding in dozens of the world\u2019s major cities and resulting in a global sea-level rise of 56cm. It is estimated that that global GDP will be cut by 13%. 400 million more people will suffer from water scarcity and heat waves in the northern latitudes will kill thousands each summer; this will be worse along the equator. In India, there would be 32 times as many extreme heat waves, each lasting five times as long and exposing 93 times more people. This is our best-case scenario.<\/p><p>At three degrees, southern Europe will be in permanent drought. The average drought in Central America would last 19 months, in the Caribbean, 21 and in northern Africa, 60 months- five years. Those areas burned annually by wildfires would double in the Mediterranean and sextuple in the US. Cities from Miami Beach to Jakarta will be submerged by sea-level rise and damages from river flooding will grow 30-fold in Bangladesh, 20-fold in India and up to 60-fold in the UK. This level of warming is better than we\u2019d do if all of the nations of the world honoured their Paris commitments- which <a href=\"https:\/\/climateactiontracker.org\/countries\/\" target=\"_blank\">only a handful are<\/a>.<\/p><p>At four degrees, there would be eight million cases of dengue fever each year in Latin America alone. Global grain yields would fall by as much as 50%, producing annual or close-to-annual food crises. The global economy would fall more than 30% than without climate change, and we would see at least half again as much <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/how-the-climate-crisis-is-fuelling-extremism\/\" target=\"_blank\">conflict and warfare<\/a> as we do today.<\/p><p>While great strides have been made in terms of the plummeting costs of renewable energy and the increasing global divestment from coal, carbon emissions are still growing. It is important to decrease emissions to level and then bend the curve.<\/p><p>One way of doing this is through a carbon tax. However, a tax needs to be far higher than any of those currently in use or being considered; The IPCC has <a href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/opinion\/energy-environment\/416067-gas-at-240-per-gallon-ipcc-report-lays-out-high-cost-of-carbon\" target=\"_blank\">proposed <\/a>raising the cost of a tonne of carbon possibly as high as US$5 000 by 2030; they suggest this may have to increase by US$27 000 by 2100. Today, the average price of carbon across 42 major economies is US$8 per tonne.<\/p><p>These numbers would shock even those most optimistic; if estimates are correct, then by the end of the century, a rise in global temperature will displace up to 5 billion people, nearly two-thirds of the current global population.<\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Oxfam_East_Africa_-_A_family_gathers_sticks_and_branches_for_firewood.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Oxfam East Africa<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/for-every-1c-rise-in-temperature-a-billion-people-will-endure-insufferable-heat\/"},"Page 33":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Hunger for Animal Products is Draining US Freshwater Supply<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/ka-yee-mak\/\">Ka Yee Mak<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <\/span><span>Apr 29th 2020<\/span><span>4 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Hunger for Animal Products is Draining US Freshwater Supply\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Webp.net-resizeimage-85.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Hunger for Animal Products is Draining US Freshwater Supply\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Webp.net-resizeimage-85.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><b>Research in the journal, <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41893-020-0483-z.epdf?referrer_access_token=lwq6f9fYhYpascxCBlQf5dRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NcRI4tUpSOob5OVmynl_awiKQ6ZrpST6zlAMJ4jILQ4slvc4trkjzt_yIgLiHMpXuPzcrqNeL9tqAdgmHDtuZELX4gw1OwOwF8-roOOrpx04H3ImO8WrIXA2iUvRyqCnBXeerYv33BmxjGNdxQt1Pj1VlZuwYDOUfalXm-3P-p6w%3D%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.nationalgeographic.com\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Nature Sustainability<\/b><\/a><b>, has revealed that the world\u2019s hunger for burgers, steaks and other animal products is draining freshwater supplies in the western US and putting native fish species at risk.<\/b><\/p><p><b>\u2014<\/b><\/p><p><b>H<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uman consumption of freshwater is close to surpassing the rate at which water sources are being naturally replenished in many regions, creating water shortage risks for people and ecosystems.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The research examined the link between water shortages in 17 western states in the US, including Montana, Wyoming and Nebraska, and beef production, and shows that irrigation of cattle-feed crops is the biggest driver behind water scarcity in these regions, endangering the local ecosystem for aquatic species.<\/span><\/p><p><strong>Animal Agriculture and Water Usage<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/awellfedworld.org\/factory-farms\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Humane Society of the United States<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, each year, about 39 million cattle and calves are killed for food in the US.

However, it has also become one of the victims of the massive beef production. From 2000 to 2015, the overconsumption of the basin has dried the river and depleted major storage reservoirs, posing severe risk of freshwater shortages as result of the consumption of beef and animal products in Los Angeles, Denver and San Francisco.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, America is not the only culprit.

Further, would it be truly sustainable, or would it result in a food shortage? Another implication of organic farming is the products\u2019 higher prices compared to those of conventional farming. For example, according to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.consumerreports.org\/cro\/news\/2015\/03\/cost-of-organic-food\/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumer Reports study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one head of organic iceberg lettuce cost at least one and a half times more than its conventional counterpart in two of the three grocery stores surveyed.

This may not always be the case.

There are examples of both large scale international projects, as well \u2018grassroots\u2019 approaches. One such global project- the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bonnchallenge.org\/content\/challenge\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bonn Challenge<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 is a global effort to restore 350 million hectares of deforested and degraded land by 2030. The challenge also aims \u2018to restore ecological integrity at the same time as improving human well-being through multifunctional landscapes\u2019. It has been estimated that reaching the 2030 goal would generate USD 170 billion per year in net benefits from \u2018watershed protection, improved crop yields and forest products, and could sequester up to 1.7 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually\u2019.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A \u2018grassroots\u2019 example of these projects put into practice is the work of Dr Willie Smits in the forests of Kalimantan and Sulawesi, an island near Borneo. What Dr Smits has come to realise and articulate in his <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/willie_smits_how_to_restore_a_rainforest?language=en\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TED talk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is that environmental degradation and environmental restoration differ only in the type and extent of human involvement in any projects which are beneficial to them, and affect the environment as a consequence.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pdfs.semanticscholar.org\/945b\/2bd3f2f030d90f79e4b4b209f6b70470c141.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the case<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> particularly in developing countries where people are often willing to agree to environmental trade-offs for money (from selling land to foreign investors) or secure jobs (such as on oil palm plantations).\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr Smits and his team from the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/masarang.nl\/en\/what-we-do\/reforestation\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Masarang Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> developed an approach to restoration of degraded land into forests which the local community participates in and benefits from at all stages from planning to execution. The approach uses an integrated design wherein trees of valuable yield, such as the sugar palm, nitrogen-fixing plants, such as fodder, and other root and tree crops are planted in a grid sequence for maximum efficiency. This approach, focused on biodiversity, encourages the return of beneficial soil microbes and improves soil texture and the retention of nutrients and water.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all land is suitable for reforestation and the data available\u00a0 is largely confined to remote satellite sensing. This means that obtaining the larger picture does not distinguish between publicly and privately owned land, making the theory more complicated in practice. Additionally, initiatives are often poorly planned. For example, about 10% of countries participating in the Bonn Project have committed to reforest more land than they actually have available. Bearing in mind its limitations, this idea holds great potential for the future.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For successful restoration to take place, the end goal doesn\u2019t always necessarily have to be a forest.

Through the Florianopolis Declaration, it was concluded that the purpose of the IWC is the conservation of whales and that they would safeguard the marine mammals in perpetuity to allow for the recovery of all whale populations to pre-industrial whaling levels. In response to this, Japan announced that it believed that the IWC had failed in its duty to promote sustainable hunting. It withdrew its membership from the IWC and resumed commercial hunting in its territorial waters in July 2019, but claimed that it would cease whaling activities in the Southern Hemisphere.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The whaling industry in Japan has this year received a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-japan-whaling-whalewatching\/in-japan-the-business-of-watching-whales-overshadows-resumption-of-hunt-idUSKCN1U402J\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">subsidy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of US $47 million from the government to continue whaling.

Areas of the Earth in which water is found in a solid, frozen form are now termed the Cryosphere, which is considered one of the Earth\u2019s five biospheres.

Most initial research focused on microbial communities living at the bedrock-ice interface due to their influence on nutrient export to fjord and ocean environments. Surface ice environments, comprised of snow packs, bare ice, lakes and streams, have recently begun to take centre stage as microbial communities thriving in these habitats have drastically changed the physical appearance of glaciers and ice sheets worldwide. Areas of high microbial abundance and activity, known as cryoconite holes, have quickly become the primary focus of attention in surface ice environments.

Indeed, when ambient temperatures rise well above mean levels, mental health admissions to hospitals increase. However, while temperature is associated with mental health and quality of life, the direct association of rising temperatures with mental health is stymied by the complexity of suicide cases.<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.annualreviews.org\/doi\/full\/10.1146\/annurev-psych-010418-103023#\" target=\"_blank\"><span>panel study<\/span><\/a><span> examining 67 countries concluded that the warmer the coldest month of the year, the happier the country and the warmer the hottest month of the year, the less happy the country. The study included variables such as economic indicators, sociocultural factors and life expectancy to rule out alternative explanations for the differences in happiness.<\/span><\/p><p>Furthermore, the study used projected changes in temperature to predict happiness levels over 30 and 60 years and found that as temperatures increase, countries at higher latitudes may become happier, while tropical and subtropical countries may become unhappier.<\/p><\/li><li><b>Social Interaction, Crime and Conflict<br\/> <\/b>As the climate crisis intensifies, an increase in crime could be seen, particularly at lower latitudes. A study found that given existing US data on assaults, murders and annual temperatures in a set of 50 US cities over a 48- year period, an average annual increase of 2\u00b0F in the US would result in a staggering 24,000 additional murders\/assaults each year.<p>Studies looking at fluctuations in temperature in the same populations over time show increased intergroup conflict, especially in low income, agriculturally-dependant regions. For example, increased temperatures result in reduced rainfall, damaging crop yields and leading to economic distress and resource scarcity. Additionally, economic pressure caused by insufficient infrastructure and unemployment may exacerbate climate-related migration.<\/p><p>The climate crisis may strengthen authoritarian trends globally, as discussed in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0272494411000752\" target=\"_blank\"><span>study<\/span><\/a><span> published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology.

We were wondering if this tax credit was sufficient to change the behaviour of stakeholders; that is, could building a large pipeline be profitable? The answer is that the cost for capturing CO<sub>2<\/sub> directly from traditional power-plant smokestacks is still too high. However, if we examine sources with lower capture costs such as ethanol refineries, the economics indicate that the pipeline infrastructure can be built. With an investment to over-size the pipeline, it would then be able to accommodate future carbon capture activities associated with larger-scale carbon sources like power plants. Our hope is to see a higher number of larger-scale CCUS projects in the U.S. before the policy expires.<\/p><p><strong>Q: The findings and the message of your paper have important implications for other countries. In particular, they seem to be highly relevant to China, a country with abundant carbon sources as well as possible storage sites. What is your opinion on this?<\/strong><\/p><p>A: China is extremely important to the entire story. One thing we should keep an eye on is at which level China\u2019s planned national carbon price will be set. Despite a widespread interest in CCUS, we need to appreciate that it is driven by economics\u2014it is always cheapest to do nothing and emit CO<sub>2<\/sub> into the air as long as that does not cost anything. Only an economic incentive like a carbon price on emissions, or the tax credit available in the US, will change behaviour and allow CCUS to develop at large scales.<\/p><p><strong>Q: Our readers are curious about the basic science of geologic carbon storage. Could you explain how scientists estimate the storage capacity and what are the major issues?<\/strong><\/p><p>A: Basically, we can estimate how much CO<sub>2<\/sub> can be stored in a specific site by assessing the volume of pore space in suitable rock formations deep underground. This volume of pore space if often very large, but typically only a small fraction of the space can actually be accessed by the injected CO<sub>2<\/sub>. Also, in addition to the overall volume available, it is important for the rocks to be sufficiently permeable so that the CO<sub>2<\/sub> can be injected at the rate needed to match the rate of capture. This overall dynamic is important to consider. <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1115347109\" target=\"_blank\">The best study I\u2019ve seen<\/a>\u00a0was done by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in which the authors examine not only how much CO<sub>2<\/sub> can be injected, but at what rate.

Nationwide CO<sub>2<\/sub> storage capacity in the U.S. estimated by Szulczewski et al. (2012)<sup>2 <\/sup><br\/>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1115347109\" target=\"_blank\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences<\/a>.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Q: It seems that one of the key challenges for CCUS is to safely store CO<sub>2<\/sub> without leakage for a very long time. How do scientists address this challenge?<\/strong><\/p><p>A: CO<sub>2<\/sub> needs to be stored underground for on the order of 1 000 years, to allow the climate system to stabilise appropriately. Such long-time scales for underground storage make direct observation impossible. As a monitoring procedure, we need to take as many field measurements as possible and combine them with different computational models and predictive tools. Leakage is of course an important issue, but our recent studies have shown that leakage along critical pathways involving old oil and gas wells appears to be quite small. This means that large-scale leakages of stored CO<sub>2<\/sub> are not expected to occur.<\/p><p><strong>Q: It is often said that a critical challenge in deploying commercial-scale CCUS is the lack of business cases and the uncertainties in climate change policy. In your viewpoint, what would be the key to the further promotion of CCUS, in terms of technology, economics or politics?<\/strong><\/p><p>A: Because political actions involving carbon taxes or tax credits is required to make the economics of CCUS tractable, politics becomes an important part of the CCUS story. The good news is that carbon pricing is becoming more widespread, and this will eventually encourage CCUS to move forward. There is also some apparently good news with new technology for carbon capture: A company called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/energy-and-environment\/2018\/6\/1\/17416444\/net-power-natural-gas-carbon-air-pollution-allam-cycle\" target=\"_blank\">NETPower has developed a new power plant<\/a> that, according to the company, costs no more than a traditional coal-fired power plant while producing a pure stream of CO<sub>2<\/sub> that is easy to capture. It means, with no separation cost, the entire economics of CCUS will change.<\/p><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-717\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Picture3.png\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Picture3.png 939w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Picture3-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Picture3-768x576.png 768w\" height=\"704\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20939%20704'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"939\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-717\" height=\"704\" sizes=\"(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Picture3.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Picture3.png 939w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Picture3-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Picture3-768x576.png 768w\" width=\"939\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption><br\/>Fig. 3. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.princeton.edu\/cee\/people\/display_person\/?netid=celia\" target=\"_blank\">Professor Michael Celia<\/a> (middle), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.choogroup.org\/jinhyun-choo\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Jinhyun Choo<\/a> (right), <br\/>and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/hoon-yun\" target=\"_blank\">Hoon Yun<\/a> for Earth.Org (left) during the interview.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Prof. Celia also touched on one central concern: <strong>should we pursue CCUS in spite of the small but ever-present risk of leakage, or continue with business as usual and face the consequences of unbridled climate change?<\/strong> He stressed that he saw CCUS as an option which is sufficiently safe and available worldwide to play a key role in fighting climate change.<\/p><p>Sheltering below a temperature increase of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius as recommended by the Paris Agreement requires achieving zero net emission by mid-century. All realistic scenarios that account for this eventuality involve an extensive use of this carbon capture technology. Deploying CCUS in combination with renewables would prolong the use of fossil fuels in future energy portfolios without jeopardising the environment, and lead to a practical and cost-effective solution.\u00a0<\/p><p>Professor Celia\u2019s concluding remarks revealed his genuine belief in this promising technology: \u201cPolitics and economics have to play a major role in the development of CCUS. While the timing of that is unknown, given that CCUS is expected to play a major role at some point in the future, as a research community, we need to be prepared for large-scale deployment.\u201d<\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\">\u00a0Featured image courtesy of Princeton University\u00a0<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/new-frontiers-for-carbon-capture-an-interview-with-prof-michael-celia-director-of-the-princeton-environmental-institute\/"},"Page 48":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Fighting For Their Future: Youth Climate Strikes Take Off Worldwide<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <\/span><span>Feb 1st 2019<\/span><span>3 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Fighting For Their Future: Youth Climate Strikes Take Off Worldwide\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Berlin-strikes-1024x768.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Fighting For Their Future: Youth Climate Strikes Take Off Worldwide\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Berlin-strikes-1024x768.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>Greta Thunberg has become one of the voices of a generation who is demanding urgent action to slow the rise in global temperatures and is the inspiration behind climate strikes taking place around the world demanding governments to protect future generations.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>T<\/strong>he 16-year-old climate activist gained worldwide attention last August after protesting outside the Swedish parliament every day during school hours with the sign <em>Skolstrejk f\u00f6r klimatet<\/em> (school strike for the climate).

Further, greenhouse gases have reached record levels despite COVID-19 lockdowns, according to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/co2-hits-new-record-levels-despite-covid-19-lockdowns\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organization (WMO).<\/span><\/a><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, he pointed to many countries, including China, the EU and the US, setting targets to achieve carbon neutrality around the middle of the century. Renewable energy is also now cheaper than coal in many regions. Guterres said, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI firmly believe that 2021 can be a new kind of leap year \u2013 the year of a quantum leap towards carbon neutrality. Sound economic analysis is our ally.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, he urged investors and governments to turn attention towards actions that will make these pledges a reality, saying that they themselves are not enough:\u00a0 \u201cWe need all governments to translate these pledges into policies, plans and targets with specific timelines. This will provide certainty and confidence for businesses and the financial sector to invest for net zero.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guterres called for countries to put a price on carbon emissions, stop investing in fossil fuels and phase out fossil fuel subsidies, stop building new coal power plants, and to shift their fiscal base from taxing incomes to taxing pollution.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing financial assistance to developing countries is also essential to forging a global consensus on reaching net-zero emissions. Guterres said that wealthier nations must \u201cmake good\u201d on their promise to provide at least USD$100 billion a year to developing countries to help them cut emissions and adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next week, world leaders will meet at the Climate Ambition Summit to prepare for the COP26 talks that were postponed by a year to next November because of the pandemic.

This book also addresses why we, as a species, are so indifferent to climate change despite all the information we have about its disastrous consequences.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wallace-Wells\u2019 facts are generally well-presented and laid out.

He pulls no punches. \u201cIt is worse, much worse, than you think,\u201d Wallace-Wells writes. \u201cThe force of retribution will cascade down to us through nature, but the cost to nature is only one part of the story; we will all be hurting.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/un-warns-of-famine-in-4-countries\/\" target=\"_blank\">UN Warns of Famine Risk in Four Countries<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Uninhabitable Earth, <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">however, can be a dry read. Many of Wallace-Wells\u2019 paragraphs are long barrages of statistics and speculation. After a hundred or so pages (this book is over three hundred pages in total), it is easy to get tired of Wallace-Wells\u2019 repetitive writing style. His prose is not beautiful \u2013 it is unnecessarily arcane, and merely <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">functional <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in that it serves the purpose of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">showing<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you how humanity is doomed, but is in no way memorable, fun or even easy to read. Some of his sentences take up nearly the whole page!\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wallace-Wells\u2019 scope is also quite narrow. He chooses to focus almost exclusively on what may happen to humanity once we go through the predicted 2 to 8 degrees Celsius of warming between now and 2100, which makes the scope of his work rather myopic for a work focused on the environment. As he freely admits, he is not and never has been an environmentalist. In fact, he admits, he is \u201clike every other American who has spent their life fatally complacent, and wilfully deluded, about climate change,\u201d and has only recently awoken to the horrific future humanity may have unwittingly created for itself. Given his background, it is not entirely surprising that he says little about how climate change will impact other species. However, Wallace-Wells comes off as particularly insensitive about the impact of climate change on animals and other non-human lifeforms, even saying at one point that \u201cthe world could lose much of what we think of as nature, as far as I cared, so long as we could go on living as we have in the world left behind.\u201d Ultimately, his anthropocentric perspective is a missed opportunity to discuss just how dangerous climate change is for <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> living things, not just humanity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, the book says too little about <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> we <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> do to prevent this doomsday scenario from occurring. Accordingly, many of Wallace-Wells\u2019 critics have criticised his book as being overly alarmist. Although we do not and cannot dispute any of the facts he has laid out, we will have to agree with his critics that his over-focus on past events, major incidents, and what <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">happen in the future as a result of our past actions detracts from the overall impact of his book. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Uninhabitable Earth<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would have been a much more powerful piece of work had Wallace-Wells provided more insight or suggestions as to how to fix the problems we are currently facing. Ultimately, he comes off as all talk and no action.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wallace-Wells\u2019 research is also lacking at times, making his book unfocused and strikingly unfactual in places (despite, and perhaps in spite, of his barrage of facts). Certain chapters of this book \u2013 in particular, the chapter on the economic consequences of climate change \u2013 have surprisingly few citations for a work that is otherwise packed with facts. In a similar vein, when he mentions how \u201cmany of the planet\u2019s largest lakes have begun drying up, from the Aral Sea in central Asia [\u2026], to Lake Mead [\u2026],\u201d he provides no concrete proof that these changes are caused by climate change. After throwing names of various lakes and seas that are drying up at the audience, Wallace-Wells concludes this paragraph with a vague \u201c[c]limate change is only one factor in this story, but its impact is not going to shrink over time.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, I really wanted to like <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It works as a cautionary tale, but Wallace-Wells\u2019 abrasive bombardment of statistics without proper explanation, myopically anthropocentric perspective and lack of concrete suggestions for how we can protect our planet ultimately make this book an unenjoyable slog of a read.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/book-review-the-uninhabitable-earth-life-after-warming-by-david-wallace-wells\/"},"Page 8":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">How Can We Keep Our Drinking Water Safe From Rising Sea Levels?<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/saumitra-shinde\/\">Saumitra Shinde<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <\/span><span>Nov 18th 2020<\/span><span>4 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"How Can We Keep Our Drinking Water Safe From Rising Sea Levels?\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/rsz_unnamed_11.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"How Can We Keep Our Drinking Water Safe From Rising Sea Levels?\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/rsz_unnamed_11.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><b>A <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2019\/10\/29\/climate\/coastal-cities-underwater.html\" target=\"_blank\"><b>report<\/b><\/a><b> suggests that large parts of some of the world\u2019s biggest coastal cities will be submerged by 2050 due to rising sea levels.

If the trend continues, saline water will eventually find its way into consumable water reserves. Amy Shallcross, manager at Water Resource Operations, DRBC further adds, \u201cThere is a concern with climate change that we could get another record drought when we would run out of storage, in which case there would be added force pushing salt upstream from the ocean and less water to push it downstream.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Biscayne Aquifer, which supplies water to 6 million people in southern Florida, is already dealing with the problem of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/e360.yale.edu\/features\/as-sea-levels-rise-will-drinking-water-supplies-be-at-risk\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">saline water intrusion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Higher sea levels have reduced the gradient that blocks seawater from entering the interiors. As a result, canals aren\u2019t functioning by pumping out fresh water from the depths of Florida.

The climate crisis is causing frequent droughts that dry up the rivers which pump freshwater into the sea. This process keeps the saline water from entering inland. On the other hand, our glaciers are melting due to rising temperatures that increase sea levels, thus increasing the chances of seawater penetration.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While drinking water contamination from sea-level rise is a reason to worry, the ecology is also getting affected by seawater intrusion.

The water then infiltrates into aquifers if the pond is permeable and if the aquifers are near the surface.

If rainfall drops below a certain threshold, areas could shift into a savanna state.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The research team focused on the stability of tropical rainforests in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were able to explore how rainforests respond to changing rainfall and simulate the downwind effects of disappearance of forests for all tropical forests. By doing this, they answered two questions: \u201cif all the forests in the tropics disappeared, where would they grow back?\u201d and \u201cwhat happens if rainforests covered the entire tropical region of Earth?\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/europe-post-covid-19-green-energy-recovery-plans\/\" target=\"_blank\">Europe\u2019s Post-COVID-19 Green Recovery Plans Should Serve as Inspiration to Others<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team ran the simulations starting with no forests in the tropics across Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australia and watched forests emerge over time in the models, which allowed them to explore the minimum forest cover for all regions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lead author Arie Staal, formerly a postdoctoral researcher at the Stockholm Resilience Centre and the Copernicus Institute of Utrecht University, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2020\/10\/201005080859.htm#:~:text=A%20larger%20part%20of%20the,in%20the%20journal%20Nature%20Communications.\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201cThe dynamics of tropical forests is interesting. As forests grow and spread across a region this affects rainfall- forests create their own rain because leaves give off water vapour and this falls as rain further downwind. Rainfall means fewer fires leading to even more forests. Our simulations capture this dynamic.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team then ran the models a second time, in a world where rainforests entirely covered the tropical regions of Earth. However, in many places there is an insufficient amount of rainfall to sustain a rainforest, so in many places, the model forests shrank due to a lack of moisture. Staal says, \u201cAs forests shrink, we get less rainfall downwind and this causes drying leading to more fire and forest loss: a vicious cycle.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, the team examined what will happen if emissions keep rising this century along a \u201cvery high-emissions\u201d scenario used by the IPCC. The team found that as emissions grow, more parts of the Amazon lose their natural resilience, become unstable and more likely to dry out and transform to a savanna-type ecosystem. Even the most resilient parts of the rainforest will shrink. This means that more of the rainforest is likely to cross a tipping point as emissions reach very high levels.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conclusion? The smallest area that can sustain a rainforest in the Amazon contracts a substantial 66% in the high-emissions scenario.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ingo Fetzer of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, says, \u201cWe understand now that rainforests on all continents are very sensitive to global change and can rapidly lose their ability to adapt. Once gone, their recovery will take many decades to return to their original state. And given that rainforests host the majority of all global species, all this will be forever lost.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In comparison, the minimal and maximal extents of the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia are relatively stable because their rainfall is more dependent on the ocean around them than on rainfall generated as a result of forest cover.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to note that the study only explored the impacts of the climate crisis on tropical forests; it did not assess the additional stress of deforestation in the tropics due to agricultural expansion and logging. It is possible then that the Amazon may cross a tipping point even sooner because of relentless deforestation in the region, encouraged by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To mitigate deforestation of the Amazon by human impact, international and domestic actors must cooperate to find a solution. While the Bolsonaro administration has made its stance on deforestation and environmental conservation abundantly clear, the country\u2019s decentralised federal governing system allows for a great deal of executive and legislative autonomy for Brazilian states. Individual states can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/5816243\/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-coronavirus-governors\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">break from the party line<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as demonstrated during the country\u2019s COVID-19 outbreak, when states opted to dismiss the President\u2019s recommendations and implement their own ordinances to soften the effects of the virus. Individual states and governors will need to unite behind a common goal of slowing deforestation. Once this happens, international organisations and domestic NGOs could bypass President Bolsonaro\u2019s protectionist policies and deal directly with the states that govern areas at risk of deforestation, by subsidising economic programmes that incentivise illegal loggers to pursue other opportunities.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/cifor\/35781446921\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr\u00a0<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/amazon-at-risk-of-crossing-tipping-point\/"},"Page 12":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Does China Have a Pork Crisis?<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/oliver-yorke\/\">Oliver Yorke<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <\/span><span>Oct 13th 2020<\/span><span>5 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Does China Have a Pork Crisis?\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/rsz_jo-anne-mcarthur-zns5tjgasoo-unsplash.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Does China Have a Pork Crisis?\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/rsz_jo-anne-mcarthur-zns5tjgasoo-unsplash.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>Pork is a big deal in China.

To reduce harm to urban environments, Chinese pig producers must invest in building waste treatment facilities that cost about 500 yuan (USD$70.57) per sow to prevent farm waste from polluting urban areas.

Arctic amplification is largely attributed to the loss of sea ice as the ice plays two key roles in regulating near-surface air temperature. First, it provides an albedo feedback. Simply put, the light colour of the sea ice, compared to the Arctic ocean beneath it, reflects a majority of incoming solar radiation back into the atmosphere, preventing it from being absorbed and warming the environment. Second, its thickness provides insulation between the warmer ocean below and the cooler air above. Therefore, as temperatures rise and sea ice melts, more of the Arctic ocean will be exposed meaning more solar radiation will be absorbed by the darker ocean, causing the ocean temperatures to rise. Further, with sea ice thinning, or being lost completely, insulation provided by the sea ice decreases, resulting in increased air temperature due to its closer proximity to a warmer ocean. As air temperatures rise, the phase of precipitation changes in concert leading to rainfall replacing snowfall and an extension of the rainy season.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/sudan-climate-crisis\/\" target=\"_blank\">Floods in Sudan Have Shone a Light on its Vulnerability to the Climate Crisis<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to classify the emergence of a new climate for any of these three factors, researchers needed to characterise twentieth century climate and compare it to observed and simulated twenty-first century climate to determine if the extreme changes occurring are a result of climate change, and thus a new climate, or if they fall within natural internal variability. While the problem seems straightforward, coming to a solution is anything but. Observational data in the Arctic is sparse and is sourced largely from the modern satellite era, beginning in 1979, which itself was a period of drastic change in the Arctic. Further, limited records also suggest a period of warming and sea ice loss during the 1950\u2019s, making it extremely difficult to characterise twentieth century Arctic climate. Yet, using a multi-model, the study was able to robustly characterise the past Arctic climate and simulate the twenty-first century climate using the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.carbonbrief.org\/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> scenario put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the \u2018worst case scenario\u2019 or \u2018business as usual\u2019 projection for greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The study concludes that the Arctic is already transitioning from a cryosphere-dominated system, with the average extent of sea ice in September, the time of year when sea ice extent is at its minimum, having decreased by 31% from the beginning of the satellite era (1979 \u2013 1988). Further, they report a new Arctic climate of sea ice as having already emerged, beginning in the late twentieth century to the beginning of this century.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the RCP 8.5 scenario, all five models simulate a completely ice-free summer by 2100 with air temperatures exceeding those of lower latitudes. Daily fall-winter temperatures are also projected to increase by 16 \u2013 28 \u00b0C for most of the Arctic Ocean. Lastly, rainfall will replace snowfall with an extension of the rainy season by 2 \u2013 4 months. This new Arctic climate and the predicted changes set to accompany it will take a heavy toll on both the ecosystem and people who live and rely on these Arctic environments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to remember, however, that these simulations are based on the \u2018worst case scenario\u2019 of greenhouse gas concentrations, with the study noting that a reduction in greenhouse gases could postpone or even completely prevent the emergence of future new Arctic climates. This is important as the study estimates that a new climate of air temperature and precipitation phase change will emerge in the first to middle half of this century and in the middle half of this century respectively.\u00a0 It is therefore still feasible that this future does not need to become our new reality. With efforts and plans made now, we can all decrease our carbon footprint and ensure that the \u2018worst case scenario\u2019 is not the path we choose to follow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/duncan\/7111182427\/in\/photolist-bQoEMz-2iThvVb-c7qnh-eTfhXz-ekKqAh-92Zc98-59yds-52Mzo9-cAEvu-bBtZa9-x6wZ9X-9Vsjbw-2jeDdPz-RN9vvN-w9vKmC-C8Vp8-58hbte-auQiVe-eKnYP-vhU5G7-CmWjww-2A6aZM-2fGuzs-mEKC7E-9Loux9-7BMWvt-bcZeFe-qLJ1os-2FF2Z9-pk1dy-88RUd8-6VfSMB-ekDEZZ-do6xuE-735U4u-52MvdN-735Tey-46LJ8e-6NkAS-d2Te-735TPd-735SNj-731Vge-MG3T5-7SSAky-6VjVVb-735Tvb-4ZXtup-731VbB-731UuM\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/arctic-is-shifting-to-a-new-climate\/"},"Page 14":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Will We Be Able to Reverse Trump\u2019s Climate Damage?<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <\/span><span>Sep 25th 2020<\/span><span>11 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Will We Be Able to Reverse Trump\u2019s Climate Damage?\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/30020735733_f83fcbdda6_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Will We Be Able to Reverse Trump\u2019s Climate Damage?\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/30020735733_f83fcbdda6_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>When he talks about the Trump administration, David Doniger likes to say: \u201cImagine where we\u2019d be if they knew what they were doing.\u201d The climate lawyer and senior advisor to the NRDC Action Fund spends his days defending the environment from the U.S. government, and for the past three and a half years, that\u2019s meant a front-row seat to the Trump administration\u2019s relentless attacks on any regulation that\u2019s meant to slow the\u00a0<a data-tag=\"climate-crisis\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/t\/climate-crisis\/\" id=\"auto-tag_climate-crisis\" target=\"_blank\">climate crisis<\/a>.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>B<\/strong>ut it\u2019s also been a window into the hasty, sloppy, and legally dubious ways that they\u2019ve gone about it.\u00a0\u201cOne of the hallmarks of this administration is how incompetently they\u2019re doing this,\u201d says Doniger. \u201cIt shows up in how slowly they\u2019ve been able to work, and how flimsy their legal rationales are.\u201d Almost all of Trump\u2019s attempts at deregulation \u2014 some 100 rules that he\u2019s tried to eliminate or weaken \u2014 are being challenged in court, and environmentalists are steadily winning. According to the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/policyintegrity.org\/trump-court-roundup\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Institute for Policy Integrity<\/a> at New York University, the Trump administration has lost 69 of the 83 legal challenges it\u2019s faced in its climate deregulatory blitz.<\/p><p>\u201cWe were saved by their incompetence,\u201d says Andrew Wetzler, from the NRDC Action Fund,\u00a0mainly by their failure to follow basic rule-making procedures.\u00a0They rushed through the process, often shortening or entirely skipping over the required 60 days for public comment, which provided a clear opening for their rule changes to be challenged in court.\u00a0The administration\u2019s ineptitude has given environmentalists hope that if Trump loses the election, the policy impact of his unrelenting pro-fossil fuel agenda could ultimately be short-lived. \u201cIf he\u2019s a one-term wonder,\u201d says Doniger, \u201cthe biggest consequence of the Trump administration may just turn out to be lost time.\u201d<\/p><p>But time, at this hour of the climate fight, might be our most precious resource. As we stumble ever closer to the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/e360.yale.edu\/features\/as-climate-changes-worsens-a-cascade-of-tipping-points-looms\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">collapse of ice sheets, oceans and forests<\/a>,\u00a0the range of meaningful action we could take narrows. There is now believed to be more carbon dioxide in the air than any time in the last 3 million years. Our oceans are on track by the end of this century to become more acidic than they\u2019ve been in some 15 million years \u2014 when they were enduring a major extinction event. Those oceans are also rising steadily enough to threaten the homes of 150 million people in the next three decades.\u00a0\u201cWe lost years at a critical time,\u201d says Wetzler. \u201cWe\u2019re on the precipice of a number of climate and biological tipping points.\u201d And, he says, we won\u2019t fully understand the impact of that loss for years.<\/p><p>If Biden wins in November, environmentalists say, his administration would have a slim window of opportunity to get our agencies back on track to meet the enormity of the climate crisis. \u201cIt means being aggressive from day one,\u201d says Brett Hartl from the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund. \u201cAnd not futzing around \u2014 knowing what you\u2019re going to do and implementing it immediately.\u201d<\/p><p>Making up for the lost time won\u2019t be easy. Despite his slap-dash approach, Trump still managed to scramble the trajectory of American climate policy, creating a tangle of legal fights that will have to be cleared up for U.S. climate policy to move forward. And he left almost no part of our environmental regulatory structure untouched \u2014\u00a0 greenlighting fossil fuel infrastructure like the Dakota Access and Keystone XL Pipelines, setting us back on emission-reduction goals by reversing the Clean Power Plan and higher fuel-efficiency standards, and gutting the federal agencies that should be at the helm of our climate response.<\/p><p>So how difficult will it be to unscramble this mess? It would have to happen in three parts, environmentalists say, and all three would have to start on day one. First, Biden would have a powerful arsenal of executive tools available to him \u2014 if he chooses to use them. A<a href=\"http:\/\/climatepresident.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0coalition of over 500 environmental<\/a>\u00a0groups has already assembled a plan for how he could effectively jumpstart our fight against the climate crisis using executive powers, which would avoid both going through Congress and the lengthy federal rule-making process.<\/p><p>Using executive power, Biden could declare a national climate emergency. It wouldn\u2019t just send an important message to Americans \u2014 and the rest of the world \u2014 that we\u2019re taking the climate crisis seriously; it would give the administration the power to mobilize the government on a massive scale, like ordering the Secretary of Defense to redirect military spending toward the rapid development of clean energy.<\/p><p>Biden could also immediately order federal agencies to reverse the climate rollbacks Trump introduced through executive order \u2014 like allowing oil and gas companies to side-step state approval \u2014 and start issuing his own. Most urgently, Biden would have the power to keep more fossil fuels in the ground: He could direct the Secretary of the Interior to halt oil-and-gas leasing and fracking on federal lands, reinstitute the ban on exporting crude oil, and order all federal agencies to deny permits for new fossil fuel infrastructure, like pipelines, storage facilities, and refineries.<\/p><p>He\u2019d also be able to change the ways that money moves through the energy sector. He could prohibit the U.S. government from financing fossil fuel programs overseas and end all Department of Energy loans for fossil fuels stateside, while also requiring the Federal Reserve to manage climate risks \u2014 forcing it to acknowledge the current and future impact of\u00a0<a data-tag=\"climate-change\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/t\/climate-change\/\" id=\"auto-tag_climate-change\" target=\"_blank\">climate change<\/a>\u00a0on our economy.<\/p><p>Many of these tools were already available in the Obama era, but the administration chose not to use them. For example, \u201cthe Clean Air Act is actually quite clear that you have the authority to set national ambient air quality standards,\u201d says Hartl. \u201cIt would have been incredibly bold, and it actually wouldn\u2019t have had the problems that the Clean Power Plan had. They could have really moved the needle on greenhouse gases in a very, very powerful way.\u201d But, Hartl says, the Obama administration shied away from these kinds of actions for fear of political consequences.<\/p><p>Biden would face a very different national landscape. At the beginning of this year,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2020\/04\/21\/how-americans-see-climate-change-and-the-environment-in-7-charts\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">two thirds of American adults said that protecting the environment should be a top priority of the federal government<\/a>, up from only 30 percent at the beginning of Obama\u2019s first term.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/09\/19\/914233038\/poll-climate-becomes-top-priority-for-democrats-trump-struggles-on-race-covid-19\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">In a poll last week<\/a>, likely Democratic voters ranked climate change as the most important issue to them in this election, and Data for Progress, a progressive think tank, has found that talking about climate change could actually help persuade voters who are on the fence to vote for a Democrat. All of this is to say, a Biden administration could have an unprecedented political mandate to take action on the climate crisis.<\/p><p>In addition to issuing executive orders, beginning on day one Biden would also need to start the process of unwinding the climate deregulation efforts that Trump carried out through the federal rule-making process \u2014 like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/08\/12\/climate\/endangered-species-act-changes.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rollbacks on the Endangered Species Act<\/a>\u00a0and fuel-emissions standards \u2014 and writing new ones to take their place. Environmentalists are confident that a new administration could systematically undo each rollback, but that process could take two years, according to Hartl.<\/p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1065076\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1065076\">Activists gather in John Marshall Park for the Global Climate Strike protests on September 20th, 2019 in Washington. Climate change has become a top issue for Democratic voters, and Biden would have an unprecedented mandate to take action to address the climate crisis.<\/p><\/div><p>And the Biden administration would need to learn from Trump\u2019s mistakes. Legal challenges from the industries that these regulations impact \u2014 the American Petroleum Institute, the National Mining Association \u2014 are inevitable, \u201cso you have to go in and be prepared to defend it the first time,\u201d says Hartl. That means following the process to the letter: establishing rules with legal backing from legislation like the Clean Air and Clean Water acts; opening the rule up to public comment; and then presenting a final rule that can stand up in court. Unlike Trump\u2019s deregulation efforts, which were fighting against decades of environmental legislation, the law would be on Biden\u2019s side. \u201cThe reality is that when Congress passed these laws,\u201d says Hartl, \u201cthey were designed to make the environment better.\u201d<\/p><p>Finally, Biden would have to start hiring like mad. Over the past four years, Trump\u2019s EPA and Interior Department have hemorrhaged talent. The Bureau of Land Management moved the majority of its staff out of Washington, D.C., leading some 70 percent of that staff to resign, and the EPA is nearly as small as it was during the Nixon era, when the EPA was founded. \u201cThat pattern, in the most extreme way, is mirrored throughout the environmental agencies,\u201d says Wetzler. \u201cThere\u2019s been a real brain drain of people who can\u2019t stand in an agency and support the anti- climate agenda under the Trump administration, and we\u2019ll have to put back the pieces of very demoralized, and in some cases broken agencies.\u201d<\/p><p>But from those ashes, Biden could build a coalition of climate advocates across his Cabinet. His transition team, and the 4,000 people they appoint,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/newrepublic.com\/article\/158198\/inside-fight-shape-bidens-climate-policy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">are arguably more influential than any campaign promises he could make<\/a>. \u201cPersonnel is policy,\u201d says Jamal Raad, co-founder and campaign director for Evergreen Action, founded by former staffers of Gov. Jay Inslee\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cWe need to choose regulators that have a climate lens,\u201d and that lens doesn\u2019t end at the EPA \u2014 it can reach the Department of Agriculture, where we have to reimagine our food production to work with our changing climate, or the Treasury, where regulators could interpret the Dodd-Frank consumer protection act to include climate risks. And within the White House, Raad says, Biden could create a National Climate Council that\u2019s equivalent to the National Economic Council. \u201cThere needs to be a plan to reorient the federal government so that climate is a lens in all decision making.\u201d<\/p><p>Heading into the general election, pressure from the left wing of the party shaped Biden\u2019s $2 trillion climate plan, which is \u201ca green new deal in all but name,\u201d\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2020\/jul\/20\/joe-biden-has-endorsed-the-green-new-deal-in-all-but-name\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote activist and journalist Julian Brave NoiseCat<\/a>. \u201cIt\u2019s the most progressive, forward-leaning environmental plan that any candidate for president has ever released,\u201d says Wetzler of the NRDC Action Fund. \u201cIt would represent incredible progress.\u201d And while the Biden campaign hasn\u2019t laid out a timetable for the plan, \u201cthe Biden team has been signaling their prioritization of climate by making it central to their economic recovery plans,\u201d says Raad. \u201cI think that folks should be cautiously optimistic \u2014 but vigilant \u2014 on the prospect of climate being a priority early in the first term.\u201d<\/p><p>Of course, this all hinges on what happens in November. And if Trump is re-elected, his administration would have the chance to establish a legacy of more than just incompetence and squandered time. Four more years of Donald Trump being in charge of the environment and climate policy could permanently alter the American landscape.<\/p><p>In some cases, it would give the Trump administration time to fight back against the legal challenges they face, leaning on courts that they\u2019ve stacked with anti-environmental judges. And damage could be done that will be near impossible to undo \u2014 rules can be changed, but mines can\u2019t be unmined. The Trump administration has pursued the largest rollback of federally protected land in U.S. history. Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, for example, which Trump shrunk by 85 percent in 2017, is in the crosshairs of uranium developers. Trump\u2019s move has been mired in lawsuits, but a second term could give them the time to untangle them, and hand the land over to the uranium lobbyists.<\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/ecuador-will-allow-communities-to-vote-on-mining-projects\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ecuador Will Allow Communities to Vote on Mining Projects<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Likewise, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was just approved in August, leaving little time for leasing, let alone actual development, before Inauguration Day. But if Trump wins, those leases are likely to move forward, as will the roads, pipelines, and oil rigs that come with them, doing permanent damage to a vital and fragile ecosystem. \u201cOver time you\u2019re looking at millions and millions of acres of fossil fuel leasing,\u201d says Hartl from the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund. \u201cAnd eventually, once you get to the point where they\u2019re actually putting drills in the ground, it\u2019s very hard to undo that. You\u2019re locking in a tremendous amount of fossil fuel infrastructure.\u201d<\/p><p>Trump\u2019s influence on the Supreme Court looms heavily for the environment as well. With Trump already raring to appoint a new justice to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a second term is likely to offer him a fourth Supreme Court appointment, which would mean the highest court would house<i>\u00a0seven<\/i>\u00a0Republican-appointed justices. When you\u2019re suing over environmental issues, the court\u2019s make-up can be the difference between having your day in court, and not. \u201cFor example, there\u2019s a general judicial doctrine called \u2018standing,\u2019 or your ability to go to court to pursue your aggrieved interests,\u201d explains Hartl. \u201cConservative judges want to narrow who has standing as much as possible, because that limits access to the courts. When you\u2019re fighting for the environment, and your interest is protecting an endangered species or the atmosphere or the water, they\u2019ve already made it hard for us to go to court, to have standing. And they can narrow it even further so that we don\u2019t even have recourse. Our ability to just\u00a0<i>fight<\/i>\u00a0for the environment is at stake.\u201d<\/p><p>The climate movement has never been more clear on what it is fighting for and what it needs to do, and finally has a presidential candidate who is signaling some willingness to do it. The prescription is fairly simple: Stop burning fossil fuels so we can begin drawing down the carbon in the atmosphere that\u2019s overheating our planet and disrupting the systems that have supported life on Earth as we know it. The president has a lot of power to take that action, and we have no time to lose. \u201cIt\u2019s true that we have 30 years [before an irreversible climate collapse], but\u00a0<i>when<\/i>\u00a0you act on that 30-year scale really affects how radically you have to act,\u201d says Wetzler. \u201cIf you think about where the United States was at the beginning of the Trump administration \u2014 and where the world was, in terms of taking climate change seriously \u2014 it\u2019s a huge, squandered opportunity.\u201d This November, we can choose to act, and set ourselves back on course. \u201cIf this is a one-time, Black Swan event, we\u2019re probably going to recover as a nation,\u201d says Doniger. \u201cThis is the project of the century.\u201d<\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/gageskidmore\/30020735733\/in\/photolist-MJQ7PX-KPpEFt-LHj5Ed-LjV16A-LDmqnV-LAL6VW-KPc6eU-LLk6Bc-KPpVdp-LAM6bs-KPqZ98-LLk8UD-LLk7QV-KPpYwD-KPcgfq-Nz4kGp-LjV7eh-LWvCB7-MQUZqq-MHUHwj-MQV1Ku-MQVrZC-MQVhKf-MQUYBG-MQVjMb-MrVzDY-MQVeA9-LWvFhh-MrVoL5-MLzRdv-LWvq7N-MHUVTd-MU1CeB-MQVajU-LWtom6-MLAwPe-MU2ivn-LWvGQ7-MLzT8c-MU2ecn-MQVwgo-MLA3zi-MLAk4F-LWtrfx-LWvB7y-MHUD9b-SjLKb8-R5KMn4-R5KKJp-R35r7q\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>This story originally appeared in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/politics\/politics-features\/trump-climate-crisis-damage-can-it-be-fixed-1064995\/\" target=\"_blank\">Rolling Stone<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/grist.org\/politics\/kamala-harris-is-bidens-vp-pick-what-does-that-mean-for-the-climate\/\" target=\"_blank\">,<\/a> written by Hannah Murphy, and is republished here as a part of Earth.Org\u2019s partnership with Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.<\/em><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/reversing-climate-damage-by-trump\/"},"Page 15":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Facebook Has a New Plan to Fight Climate Misinformation<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Sep 16th 2020<\/span><span>3 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Facebook Has a New Plan to Fight Climate Misinformation\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/rsz_1024px-mark_zuckerberg_f8_2018_keynote_41793468182.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Facebook Has a New Plan to Fight Climate Misinformation\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/rsz_1024px-mark_zuckerberg_f8_2018_keynote_41793468182.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>In the geographic heart of the tech industry Wednesday, it was hard to think of anything except the orange skies, dark and tinted by wildfire smoke. The image software on iPhones failed to capture the dystopian hue, or the feeling of being surrounded by it. Silicon Valley workers tweeted that it felt like night time, or a perpetual sunset, or a scene from \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d It marked the fourth week of severe fire and ash in the Western U.S. News sites around the world have rightly attributed these devastating fires to the climate crisis, which is accelerating in pace, but some, like the US President, refuse to do so. Now, Facebook is implementing tools to fight this climate misinformation.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>T<\/strong>he conversation shifted from the already-apocalyptic pandemic to another global public health disaster: climate change. For those who don\u2019t know, this is not what California is usually like. The first time I smelled smoke in my San Francisco apartment, in 2015, I imagined something nearby was on fire\u2014not that it was happening miles north of the city. I turned on an air purifier, which I\u2019d purchased for my partner\u2019s allergies, never expecting it would be necessary for anything else.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The climate disaster is undeniable to those who have experienced its harms, and a political talking point for the rest. Facebook is full of misinformation on the topic, which, when noticed and reported by users, is sent to the company\u2019s third-party fact-checkers. Over the summer, a nonprofit called C02 Coalition, which claimed that carbon dioxide created by humans was beneficial for the planet, was banned from advertising on Facebook after too many fact violations. The group successfully appealed its ban, and had the fact-checks labels on its posts removed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/worst-wildfires-in-us-history\/\" target=\"_blank\">13 Worst Wildfires in US History<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook said that it considered such posts to be opinions, ineligible for fact-checking, causing a miniature scandal when the checker, Climate Feedback, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/climate-denial-spreads-on-facebook-as-scientists-face-restrictions\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spoke out<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that articles in an opinion section should be immune from fact-checking,\u201d Climate Feedback science editor Scott Johnson wrote in an email to Bloomberg.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook also doesn\u2019t take the additional step of removing misinformation on the climate, because the company has ruled that such posts don\u2019t cause imminent harm to human health.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, in the aggregate, they do. Facebook has recently re-evaluated its approach to climate misinformation, according to spokesman Andy Stone. The company is working on a climate information centre, which will display information from scientific sources. Stone said Facebook isn\u2019t ready to officially announce anything, but it\u2019s easy to imagine what this might look like. Facebook has already devised centres for factual information about COVID-19, and about voting and the upcoming election, both of which it has promoted heavily on its site.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The info centre approach would put less pressure on evaluating each individual post, in favour of directing users to what they need to know more about generally. It could plausibly be more effective than the fact-checking process, which sometimes takes days or weeks to complete, long after a claim has gone viral. Of course, it won\u2019t help address individual disputed claims.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, to get the general idea of what\u2019s going on, anyone in Silicon Valley can look out the window.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Mark_Zuckerberg_F8_2018_Keynote_(41793468182).jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Commons<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>This story originally appeared in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-10\/facebook-has-a-new-plan-to-fight-climate-misinformation\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg.com<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/grist.org\/politics\/kamala-harris-is-bidens-vp-pick-what-does-that-mean-for-the-climate\/\" target=\"_blank\">,<\/a> written by Sarah Frier, and is republished here as a part of Earth.Org\u2019s partnership with Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.<\/em><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/facebook-fight-climate-misinformation\/"},"Page 16":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Lilly Platt: Meet Earth.Org\u2019s First Global Ambassador!<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <\/span><span>Sep 9th 2020<\/span><span>8 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Lilly Platt: Meet Earth.Org\u2019s First Global Ambassador!\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-09-09T090723.741.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Lilly Platt: Meet Earth.Org\u2019s First Global Ambassador!\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-09-09T090723.741.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>Lilly Platt is an international environmental champion.

I was shocked!

After we finish the pick-ups every Sunday, we sort the rubbish out into columns and groups so cans go with cans, bottles with bottles, etc, and then my grandpa and I take pictures of what we\u2019ve collected and post it on social media so that people can see what I\u2019ve picked up each week. At the end of the year, we count how much plastic we have collected, and it\u2019s an explosive number!<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We found more than 22 000 pieces of plastic!

Sometimes, a few school strikers from around the world have a zoom meeting and every Friday, we post a picture of a school striking sign or make a positive video about what we can do for the planet while in quarantine and things like that. Since 2018, I\u2019ve done more than 100 strikes!<\/span><\/p><p><b>EO: Congratulations, Lilly! What do you think the biggest issues facing the planet are (besides the plastic problem)?\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p><b>Lilly Platt: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that all environment problems are connected in a way. Plastic needs fossil fuels to be created and fossil fuels put a lot of CO2 into the atmosphere, thus linking plastic pollution and climate change together and creating a cluster of disastrous environmental problems. Another problem that I think is quite severe is that politicians and other people in high places don\u2019t listen to those who actually do something for the planet. Once, me and a couple of other school strikers from across Europe went to the European parliament in Strasbourg to have climate debates for two days. The second day was a big disappointment because there was this room with at least 751 seats and only 27 showed up. Only 3 said something good about what we were doing or said something helpful for climate change, which was such a big disappointment. One of the three politicians, Bas Eickhout, a Dutch politician, said something that I will always remember. He said that if climate change was a bank, it would\u2019ve been saved by now. I think we should do everything in our power to solve environmental problems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>EO: What challenges have you encountered while doing your activist work?<\/b><\/p><p><b>Lilly: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have received so many comments saying things like \u201cshe\u2019s just a child, let the grown-ups handle this,\u201d or \u201cthis is fake news, how dare you do something like this?\u201d My mum always checks my messages so that I don\u2019t get discouraged or feel negative about what I\u2019m doing. Another negative comment happened during one of my school strikes; there was a lady on a motorbike who read one of my school striking signs out loud and after parking, told me I was doing something illegal and I was going to get a fine. I heard that when she was younger, she got in trouble for striking about animal protection and she lost her connection to nature. Throughout history, humanity has lost its green heart but I believe that children still have theirs. All they have to do is share it with the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>EO: What do your friends and family think about what you\u2019re doing?<\/b><\/p><p><b>Lilly: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My family is 100 and infinity percent supportive of what I do and they always help me with my projects!\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At my previous school, my schoolmates didn\u2019t really think much of what I did and made some negative comments, until my teacher showed them one of my videos and they were a bit starstruck haha!<\/span><\/p><p><b>Lilly\u2019s Mum: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s difficult to do the school strikes: they have a law in the Netherlands called t<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he Compulsory Education Act or \u2018Leerplicht\u2019<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Act and so we had to get permission to take Lilly out of school to do these strikes. If you do a lot of sports in the Netherlands, they are generally very supportive, but when you talk about environmental things, then you get \u201coh, she\u2019s a hippie\u201d comments. Lilly has unfortunately had a bit of a hard time in a couple of schools, but she\u2019s done some amazing things: she\u2019s been asked to speak in Egypt by the president, we\u2019ve been to Vancouver and in Italy at the Youth Mundus Festival, she moderated an amazing panel for Amazon Watch with Amazon leaders, who came especially to see her. She\u2019s even had people like Jane Goodall write to her and compliment her on her work! Unfortunately, because she\u2019s not doing a sport, a lot of what she does gets discredited, but she never loses her positive attitude. She knows that what she\u2019s doing is a good thing so we are always behind her and always letting her know her value. She has a lot of very good friends around her who do the same environmental work and they all support each other. There\u2019s a lot of people that say that their work is a \u201cparent initiative\u201d and don\u2019t believe that it can come from the heart of a child.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The headmaster of her new school saw her TED Talk and he wants her to make a program about plastic and recycling, so this will be a very good move.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>EO: What are some things that you in your personal life try to do to decrease your carbon footprint?<\/b><\/p><p><b>Lilly: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We often walk to places and use public transport.

However, they also present a growing risk from floods that can destroy villages, roads, pipelines and other infrastructure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scientists highlight particular threats to hydroelectric power plants in the Himalayas, the Trans-Alaska pipeline and major roadways such as the Karakoram highway between China and Pakistan.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fastest-growing lakes are in Scandinavia, Iceland and Russia, which all more than doubled in size, whereas the slower-growing ones are in Patagonia and Alaska. However, because many of the lakes in these regions are already vast, the increases are huge. In the north of Greenland, glacial lakes are growing rapidly and in south-west Greenland, some glacial lakes shrunk, but this was because they had already drained.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harrison says, \u201cAs lakes get bigger, there is more water in them to drain quickly and produce glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Such events have killed tens of thousands of people over the past century and destroyed valuable infrastructure, such as hydroelectric power schemes. However, this is a complex issue. Some lakes become less vulnerable to GLOF triggers as they get bigger, but the more water that is available will tend to make the GLOF worse if one occurs.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientists are working hard on ways to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.preventionweb.net\/news\/view\/70026\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">predict when GLOFs will occur<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but these events are rapid and unpredictable.

Typically there is a thick blanket of snowfall in winter which insulates the soil, shielding it from the frigid air above and keeping it milder.<\/p><p>The idea behind Zimov\u2019s on-the-ground Pleistocene Park experiment was to bring grazing animals with their stamping hooves back to the land to disperse the snow, compress the ground and chill the soil.<\/p><p>Turns out, it worked. The 100 resettled animals, across a one-square-kilometer area, cut the average snow cover height in half, dramatically reducing the insulating effect, exposing the soil to the overlying colder air and intensifying the freezing of permafrost.<\/p><p>In an effort to see what impact this method could have on a much larger scale, beyond the confines of Pleistocene Park, Professor Christian Beer of the University of Hamburg conducted a simulation experiment. His team used a special climate model to replicate the impact on the land surface throughout all of the Arctic permafrost soils in the Northern Hemisphere over the course of an entire year.<\/p><p>The results, published in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-020-60938-y\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nature journal Scientific Reports<\/a>, show that if emissions continue to rise unchecked we can expect to see a 7-degree Fahrenheit increase in permafrost temperatures, which would cause half of all permafrost to thaw by 2100.<\/p><p>In contrast, with animal herds repopulating the tundra, the ground would only warm by 4 degrees Fahrenheit. That would be enough to preserve 80% of the current permafrost though the end of the century.<\/p><p>\u201cThis type of natural manipulation in ecosystems that are especially relevant for the climate system has barely been researched to date, but holds tremendous potential,\u201d Beer said.<\/p><p>CBS News asked Beer how realistic it is to expect that the Arctic could be repopulated with enough animals to make a difference. \u201cI am not sure,\u201d he replied, adding that more research is needed but the results are promising. \u201cToday we have an average of 5 reindeers per square kilometer across the Arctic. With 15 [reindeer] per square kilometer we could already save 70% permafrost according to our calculations.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cIt may be utopian to imaging resettling wild animal herds in all the permafrost regions of the Northern Hemisphere,\u201d Beer concedes. \u201cBut the results indicate that using fewer animals would still produce a cooling effect.\u201d<\/p><p>Rick Thoman, a climate specialist at the International Arctic Research Center in Alaska, agrees that snow disturbed and trampled by animal herds is a much less efficient insulator, but he has his doubts about implementing this idea. \u201cUnless the plan is to cover millions of square kilometers with horses, bison and reindeer, how could this possibly have any significant impact? I certainly would not call it \u2018utopian\u2019 to destroy permafrost lands as we know them by having these animals in the distribution and numbers required.\u201d<\/p><p>Beer and his team did consider some potential side effects of this approach. For example, in summer the animals would destroy the cooling moss layer on the ground, which would contribute to warming the soil. This was taken into account in the simulations, but the cooling impact of the compressed snow effect in winter is several times greater, they found.<\/p><p>\u201cIf theoretically we were able to maintain a high animal density like in Zimov\u2019s Pleistocene Park, would that be good enough to save permafrost under the strongest warming scenario? Yes, it could work for 80% of the region\u201d said Beer.<\/p><p>As a next step, Beer plans to collaborate with biologists in order to investigate how the animals would actually spread across the landscape.<\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/tipsfortravellers\/20289800021\/in\/photolist-wUWwEi-wBNAZf-Cc73V6-wBNAcJ-p9rF32-PRF7hm-7zeLJS-hzNNcX-55TL4-26gKPvM-e9dHEq-nhQXjv-57DWPU-v8zBBJ-53jzxh-53fmuV-d3k29b-D9yguV-D2ec5i-SxUjx2-wTFn9b-CLhnnh-CVJFE6-BYmWGx-CZ3dB1-BYo6Qa-BYkVUy-PYizDQ-5KTW3S-5KU2m3-24BWaq8-a9JFyu-hRfBC-hRgmf-27z5u9j-2hevSYB-Pxjo1G-KNRt3S-bn7dwb-K2Mp36-rLXXF-d3jZcs-CTkReL-aEj5VE-RLedRJ-S6ZoQd-E385CE-2gSoVaW-75RmFf-2gA2eJR\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>This story originally appeared in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/climate-change-permafrost-arctic-animal-herds-pleistocene-park-siberia\/\" target=\"_blank\">CBS News<\/a> and is republished here as a part of Earth.Org\u2019s partnership with Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.<\/em><\/em><\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/releasing-herds-of-animals-into-the-arctic-could-help-fight-thawing-permafrost\/"},"Page 20":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Canada\u2019s Last Intact Ice Shelf Has Collapsed<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Aug 11th 2020<\/span><span>3 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Canada\u2019s Last Intact Ice Shelf Has Collapsed\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/4370266339_12f69e1004_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Canada\u2019s Last Intact Ice Shelf Has Collapsed\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/4370266339_12f69e1004_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>The last fully intact ice shelf in Canada in the Arctic has collapsed, having lost about 80 sq km, or 40%, of its area over a two-day period in late July, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ECCC_CIS\/status\/1290740808170307584\" target=\"_blank\">according to the Canadian Ice Service<\/a>.

Human rights are often contested and, arguably, cannot be universally applied, an issue which is further exacerbated within the context of environmental crime due to its very own lack of definition. Therefore, a fairly new concept of eco-human rights could be an acceptable approach to take to consider the issues of environmental crime and human rights collectively rather than separately.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Environmental Crimes: Definition<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>E<\/strong>nvironmental crimes are often committed by large international corporations, such as BP or Shell, who more often than not have leverage within governments and global political organisations through lobbying parliamentary, international and regulatory bodies to ensure that any laws that are passed are, to an extent, in their favour, therefore allowing them to continue harmful environmental practices.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main infliction of human rights through environmental crime is the right to a safe living environment, access to clean water and food sources. Often, it is those in developing nations who suffer most and, through their government\u2019s need for money and the persuasive nature of capitalist and money hungry corporations, feel the harsh impacts of pollution through, for example, oil spills and deforestation and the consequential domino effect as pollution engulfs ecosystems. In addition, the economic inequalities already affecting developing nations are further exacerbated as corporate environmental crime is uncovered.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/apple-carbon-neutral-by-2030\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Commits to Become Carbon Neutral by 2030<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Corporate environmental crime often goes under the radar as many of these acts are only morally wrong and may not constitute a crime, making it difficult to police. For example, a corporate body can transport oil from its place of origin to its destination which may result in a significant oil spill during its journey, thus damaging the food chain and wildlife, having far reaching consequences for both non-human and human species. However, it is incredibly rare that such acts result in criminal sanctions being brought and, more often than not, results only in financial sanctions for those involved.

This explosion resulted in obvious consequences to the environment and local industries, such as fishing and tourism. Plants and animals were completely covered in oil and marine wildlife was found dead on local beaches and coastal areas. Fish stocks were significantly lowered, affecting the livelihoods of local people. Although the Deepwater Horizon explosion was one of the largest the US had seen, it is thought that the warmer waters aided a natural healing process by breaking down the oil in the water.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BP reportedly worked with the US Government and other state-corporate actors to conceal the amount of environmental harms consequential to the explosion of Deepwater Horizon.

In addition, during the clean up operation, a chemical known as Corexit was released in an attempt to disperse the oil spill however, this was not done until some time after the initial explosion, something which BP has been heavily criticised for. For months after the explosion, it is estimated that oil continued to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/science\/2020\/04\/bp-oil-spill-still-dont-know-effects-decade-later\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contaminate the ocean floor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and it is not clear whether contamination is still continuing a decade after the initial event. The effect on the food chain was devastating, with heavily concentrated populations of plankton affected, thus, also contaminating whales and other marine life which rely on plankton as a source of food. This also affected local communities who used the Gulf of Mexico as not only a tourist hotspot but as an integral part of their source of food. Therefore, it is impossible to estimate the likely deaths and\/or illnesses caused as a result of the contamination.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has also been estimated that immediately after the spill, an estimated 1 300 miles of coastline recorded higher than usual oil concentrations, an effect which continued to show almost <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/science\/2020\/04\/bp-oil-spill-still-dont-know-effects-decade-later\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eight years after the event<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

However, the problem with policing environmental crimes is that, although they have the potential to cause significant harm and damage to life, it provides high profit margins and low risk for those involved, meaning the acts go relatively undetected and, therefore, tough to police. The European Commission has attempted to tackle environmental crime and have gone as far as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/environment\/legal\/crime\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to propose a directive<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to ensure the protection of the environment through criminal law in 2008, but it is up to each individual member state to adopt the directive into their own domestic legislation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, until criminal sanctions are imposed upon the perpetrators of environmental crime, it is a problem which is very much alive. Many perpetrators of such acts receive fines which would not cause corporations significant financial harm. Therefore, there is much more progress to be made in the war against environmental crime to ensure a cleaner, greener and safer planet for future generations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/noaa_response_restoration\/12685861633\" target=\"_blank\">Office of Response and Restoration<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/environmental-crime-violates-human-rights\/"},"Page 22":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/oceans\">Oceans<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Antarctica\u2019s Thwaites Glacier is Deteriorating at an Alarming Rate- What It Means<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/carol-konyn\/\">Carol Konyn<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Jul 20th 2020<\/span><span>5 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Antarctica\u2019s Thwaites Glacier is Deteriorating at an Alarming Rate- What It Means\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-07-20T093217.686.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Antarctica\u2019s Thwaites Glacier is Deteriorating at an Alarming Rate- What It Means\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-07-20T093217.686.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>Scientists have issued new warnings over the Thwaites Glacier, an unusually large and vast ice sheet in Antarctica, that is melting swiftly and whose collapse could lead to rapid sea level rise.

The seafloor underneath the glacier slopes downward as it goes inland- called a \u201cretrograde slope\u201d- and the ice sitting on top of it gets thicker. If the Thwaites glacier retreats far enough inland and reaches a certain thickness, it will start to collapse under its own weight.

Due to limited data, researchers were unable to confidently estimate how much shorter trees have become.<\/span><\/p><p><strong>Impact of Climate Change on Forests<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increases in temperature is one driver of tree mortality as it causes the stomata of plants to close whilst limiting the process of photosynthesis, vital for plant growth. This not only causes greater levels of tree mortality but also hinders regeneration. This causes larger plants to die, with those replacing them being smaller in size.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The effect of CO<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on forest dynamics is slightly more complex.

Where forests have insufficient access to nutrients and water, the benefit of increased CO<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> emissions isn\u2019t as pronounced. Some of the studies analysed suggest that increases in atmospheric CO<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may actually increase tree mortality rates.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As well as these longer term changes in climate and CO<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">concentrations, forests are constantly being threatened by a number of extreme weather events, made more frequent and severe due to anthropogenic climate change, as well as deforestation. Whilst the different disturbances have varying impacts on forest dynamics, the overall trend is that tree mortality is consistently increasing, causing plants to be both shorter and younger.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst recruitment and growth rates are expected to vary over time as well as geographically, the evidence suggests tree mortality rates will continue to increase in the future resulting in reduced forest canopy cover and biomass. There is however some uncertainty surrounding several feedback mechanisms, triggered by climate change and other disturbances, which could help to mitigate these changes to forest dynamics. These mechanisms include the ability of forests to adjust to changes in climate, adapt to a range of biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) factors and to migrate in response to changing climatic and environmental conditions.<\/span><\/p><p><strong>Why are forests important for mitigating climate change?<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forests act as a vital carbon sink for greenhouse gas emissions, however shifting forest dynamics pose serious implications for the total terrestrial carbon storage available.

Thus the findings from this study should be used as a critical step forward in effectively managing the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on forests now and in the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-crisis-is-causing-trees-to-become-younger-and-shorter\/"},"Page 25":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/energy\">Energy<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">As the Power of Coal Dwindles, Renewables Are Set To Come Out on Top<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/vera-sim\/\">Vera Sim<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <\/span><span>Jun 30th 2020<\/span><span>6 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"As the Power of Coal Dwindles, Renewables Are Set To Come Out on Top\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-06-30T132321.666.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"As the Power of Coal Dwindles, Renewables Are Set To Come Out on Top\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-06-30T132321.666.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>The COVID-19 crisis has led to severe economic disruptions, knocking energy markets off balance, especially the electricity sector.

Ten years ago, coal was the powerhouse of US electricity generation, accounting for half of the country\u2019s electricity. Over the years, its share has dwindled, down to 24% in 2019. In the same year, coal energy consumption was <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eia.gov\/todayinenergy\/detail.php?id=43895#\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">outpaced<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by that of renewables, a first in the US in over 130 years.

Unfortunately for coal supporters, these efforts may not prevail against the headwinds of market forces; even before COVID-19, Trump \u2013 as avid a supporter of coal as he is- could not stop the decline of coal.

It is apparent that Trump\u2019s pledge of support for coal has been unfruitful.<\/span><\/p><p><b>The Rise of Renewables and the Fall of Coals<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversely, the future of renewables appears promising. Technology has been a boon for the dramatic decrease in costs of electricity generation and storage. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lazard.com\/perspective\/lcoe2019\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lazard<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a financial advisory that analyses energy costs on an annual basis, the unsubsidised levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of coal ranges from US$66 to $152 per megawatt hour, while wind prices range from $28 to $54 and solar prices $36 to $44. LCOE describes the average cost of electricity generation by a plant over its lifetime, allowing for comparisons between energy competitiveness. Another formidable competitor in the electricity sector is natural gas, cheap and bountiful from the fracking boom. Lazard\u2019s figures show its unsubsidized LCOE to range from $44 to $68. While natural gas has been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eia.gov\/energyexplained\/electricity\/electricity-in-the-us.php\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">topping the US electricity mix<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since 2016, these numbers show that renewables are catching up in terms of cost competitiveness, which is especially welcome considering the methane emissions associated with natural gas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While natural gas <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ucsusa.org\/resources\/environmental-impacts-natural-gas\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">releases up to 60% less carbon dioxide<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than coal when burnt efficiently, methane- its <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eia.gov\/energyexplained\/natural-gas\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">primary component<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 is a much more potent greenhouse gas. While relatively short-lived, methane is still capable of packing a punch over the 20 years it lingers in the atmosphere, having a global warming impact <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/science\/2020\/02\/super-potent-methane-in-atmosphere-oil-gas-drilling-ice-cores\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">90 times greater<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than that of carbon dioxide. Given these numbers, the EIA\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eia.gov\/todayinenergy\/detail.php?id=42635\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 Annual Energy Outlook<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> comes as a relief, as it projects that renewables will eventually surpass natural gas in US electricity generation, doubling from a share of 19% in 2019 to 38% in 2050. Natural gas provided 37% of electricity in 2019, a figure that is expected to remain largely unchanged, coming to 36% in 2050.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as with coal, renewables are not immune to the repercussions of COVID-19. As the economy stagnates, renewable installation projects will be temporarily shelved or halted due to supply chain disruptions, lockdown measures and expenditure reduction by companies. The growth of renewables- globally and in the US- is thus <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/business.financialpost.com\/pmn\/business-pmn\/global-solar-wind-growth-will-be-erased-this-year-rystad-says\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expected to take a nosedive<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The pandemic is especially ill-timed for the renewable industry, as 2020 was meant to be a record year for capacity expansions. According to the International Energy Authority (IEA), renewable capacity expansions this year is set to be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iea.org\/reports\/renewable-energy-market-update\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13% less<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than that of last year, breaking its 20-year growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, this decline is not permanent, cushioned by the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/covid-19-will-slow-the-global-shift-to-renewable-energy-but-cant-stop-it-133499\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long-term trend towards carbon-free energy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which even the pandemic cannot undo. As public and economic pressure force more coal plants to shut down, the resulting vacuum in energy capacity will likely be filled by renewables. Furthermore, more states are ramping up their efforts to go carbon-free.

With people settled in these cleared patches\u2026 it can increase malaria transmission.\u201d<\/p><p>Comparing satellite images and health data, MacDonald, together with Erin Mordecai from Stanford University, determined that deforestation in the whole of the Amazon Basin has helped lead to a significant increase in malaria.\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"internal\" href=\"https:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2019\/10\/malaria-deforestation-amazon\/\" target=\"_blank\">MacDonald told Mongabay<\/a>\u00a0that the research team calculated that in 2008 a 10% rise in deforestation, that is, about 1,600 square kilometers (618 square miles) of additional forest cut, led to a 3.3% increase in malaria transmission. That amounted to an additional 9,980 cases across the region.<\/p><p><strong>Bolsonaro Paves the Way for More Deforestation<\/strong><\/p><p>In the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, the Brazilian Congress now stands ready to vote, turning a temporary 120-day Provisional Measure decreed by Bolsonaro in December 2019, into permanent law.\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"http:\/\/www.planalto.gov.br\/ccivil_03\/_ato2019-2022\/2019\/Mpv\/mpv910.htm\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Provisional Measure (MP) 910<\/a>, instead of curbing illegal land invasions, rewards land grabbers who illegally felled forest on public lands in Amazonia before December 2018 \u2014 regularizing their illegal occupation by allowing the purchase of the property at greatly reduced prices, turning it from public to private. Essentially, the measure allows land grabbers to break the law and get away with it.<\/p><p>According to\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/k6f2r3a6.stackpathcdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Nota_Tecnica_MP910_2019_FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a technical note<\/a>\u00a0issued by the not-for-profit organization, IMAZON, the MP could lead to the deforestation of up to 16,000 square kilometers (6,178 square miles) by 2027, an area ten times larger than the area that led to an increase of nearly ten thousand new cases of malaria in the MacDonald study.<\/p><p>Under the present terms of MP 910, authorities are not required to check the validity of any claim made by a potential landowner for properties under 2,500 hectares (6,166 acres) in size \u2014 a stipulation that supposedly benefits small-scale farmers.<\/p><p>But Amazon land grabbers are extremely skilled at bypassing such regulatory limits. One very common practice is to utilize\u00a0<em>laranjas<\/em>\u00a0(literally oranges, but more accurately, stooges). The big landowners get relatives, friends or employees to register a small plot in their names, avoiding federal oversight. Later, the laranjas hand the property over to the land grabber, sometimes in exchange for a small payment.<\/p><p>If a landowner employs 20\u00a0<em>laranjas<\/em>, each registering a plot of 2,500 hectares (6,166 acres), he ends up with a property of 50,000 hectares (111,000 acres). Another worrying consequence is that land grabbers can seize land occupied by indigenous communities who lack deeds, as is\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"internal\" href=\"https:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2019\/06\/the-satere-mawe-move-to-reclaim-amazon-ancestral-lands-from-invaders\/\" target=\"_blank\">happening with the Sater\u00e9-Mawe<\/a>\u00a0indigenous group in Amazonas state.<\/p><p>MP 910 also allows those who have already benefited from the regularization of invaded public lands, but who have sold that property, to join the queue again requesting a new plot. Although she recognizes the need to sort out the current anarchy over landownership in the Amazon, Suely Araujo, former president of IBAMA, the government\u2019s environmental agency, is critical of the MP. \u201cWith this flexibility, and without separating big landowners from small ones, this law legalizes those who live from land invasion, deforestation and the sale of public land,\u201d she told Mongabay.<\/p><p>On March 27, Minister Alexandre Moraes, a member of the Federal Supreme Court, Brazil\u2019s court of last resort, issued a preliminary ruling for facilitating the approval of Provisional Measures. Even though the intention is to fast-track urgent measures during the COVID-19 crisis, environmentalists fear that the ruralist lobby will take advantage of this new procedure to push ahead more energetically with their agenda. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t a political decision to withdraw MP 910 from the measures to be voted through, we run the risk of a serious environmental reverse during this [health] crisis,\u201d warned Ara\u00fajo.<\/p><p><strong>Greater Risks Ahead<\/strong><\/p><p>Even as Brazilian deforestation rates soar, and land use laws in the Amazon basin are undermined, indigenous peoples across Latin America are trying to draw attention to the gravity of the global environmental crisis, which they believe caused the COVID-19 outbreak.<\/p><p>\u201cCoronavirus is telling the world what indigenous peoples have been saying for thousands of years \u2014 if we do not help protect biodiversity and nature, we will face this, and even worse threats,\u201d\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalobserver.com\/2020\/03\/24\/news\/covid-19-crisis-tells-world-what-indigenous-peoples-have-been-saying-thousands-years\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said<\/a>\u00a0Levi Sucre Romero,\u00a0an indigenous man from Costa Rica at a press conference organized by\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.coveringclimatenow.org\/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Covering Climate Now<\/a>\u00a0in New York City in mid-March.<\/p><p>Another indigenous leader at that meeting, Dinamam Tux\u00e1, coordinator of APIB (the Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil), was just as vehement: \u201cThe cure for the next pandemic, and even for this one, can be found in the biodiversity in our indigenous lands,\u201d he\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalobserver.com\/2020\/03\/24\/news\/covid-19-crisis-tells-world-what-indigenous-peoples-have-been-saying-thousands-years\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">argued<\/a>. \u201cThis is why we need to protect our lands and rights, because the future of life depends on it.\u201d In contrast,\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"internal\" href=\"https:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2019\/12\/bolsonaros-brazil-2020-could-see-revived-amazon-mining-assault-part-two\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bolsonaro is pushing<\/a>\u00a0legislation through Congress that would allow large-scale mining, oil and gas drilling, and industrial agribusiness within Brazil\u2019s indigenous reserves, largely without input from the people living there.<\/p><p>Experts continue warning urgently that more pandemics lie ahead. \u201cI am not at all surprised about the coronavirus outbreak,\u201d disease ecologist Thomas Gillespie, an associate professor in Emory University\u2019s\u00a0Department of Environmental Sciences,\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/destroyed-habitat-creates-the-perfect-conditions-for-coronavirus-to-emerge\/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told\u00a0<em>Scientific American<\/em><\/a>. \u201cThe majority of pathogens are still to be discovered.

It seeks to enrich soil health by implementing land management practices that encourage the proliferation of soil organic matter. Not only does this reduce soil erosion, it also promotes capacity for carbon sequestration deep within the soil, which directly contributes to climate mitigation.<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/kelp-forests-lifeline-for-the-ocean\/\" target=\"_blank\">Kelp Forests: Restoring a Lifeline for the Ocean<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One practice regenerative agriculture advocates for is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/regenerationinternational.org\/2018\/06\/24\/no-till-farming\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">minimum tillage of soil<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Soil tilling is the practice of turning over soil- up to 10 inches deep- and breaking it up. Used sparingly, it can loosen hardened soil and better integrate nutrients into it, increasing crop yield. But in the long run, its usage results in soil degradation, displacing plant matter, microbes and insects within the soil structure. The result is unhealthy, bare soil that is easily eroded by wind and water. History has shown how destructive poor tillage practices can be, not just for soil health, but for the economy as well. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.history.com\/topics\/great-depression\/dust-bowl\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dust Bowl of the United States that formed in the 1930s<\/span><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a period of severe dust storms triggered by drought, stemmed from the overplowing of farmland by inexperienced farmers, rendering the land non-arable. Without the prairie grasses and their extensive roots grasping the soil firmly in place, wind erosion eventually created huge dust storms that saw the loss of farmers\u2019 livelihoods and triggered the displacement of 2.5 million people from the affected areas. Alongside economic woes caused by the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl aggravated economic disruption.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping soils intact improves the absorption and movement of water within the soil system, reducing erosion and preventing water pollution by reducing the runoff of fertilisers and other agricultural chemicals into water bodies close by. No-tilling farming can also yield healthier soils by leaving soil microbes to their own devices, enabling nutrient cycling and the growth of more nutrient-rich crops. Long-term implementation of reduced tillage can also yield more productive crops, as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2019\/12\/191206132228.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">research<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has shown.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reducing tillage can be part of the solution to the climate crisis.

With future projections of increased sea-level rise, monsoons and cyclone frequency, people are in need of long-term and cost-effective solutions.

This is a chance for nations to recover better, to include the most vulnerable in those plans, and a chance to shape the 21st century economy in ways that are clean, green, healthy, just, safe and more resilient.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><b>What Does This Mean for the Fight Against the Climate Crisis?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the constant coverage of COVID-19 (rightly so), the climate crisis will not wait its turn to be the topic of conversation again. Emissions consistent with keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will have been used up by 2030. Decisive action by governments needs to be taken now, and COP26 being postponed could hamper these efforts for another year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/green-deals-greener-world\/\" target=\"_blank\">Green Deals, Greener World<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several prominent climate experts fear that delaying the talks will mean that governments will ease off on pursuing stronger commitments to fulfil the Paris goals.

This may very well represent a turning point in the demise of experts. Hopefully, climate scientists and policy advisors will receive the same level of esteem, whereby society trusts that their advice is sound.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With any luck, this pandemic will compel governments to re-organise the way they look at aspects of everyday life, such as transport and carbon-heavy industries, to prioritise clean energy plans. This kind of cultural shift may push people to cycle or walk instead of taking public transport, for example. It is clear that we have many of the tools to make major advances in addressing the climate crisis; what is needed now is the political will to apply them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humanity needs a new way of thinking if it has any chance of surviving the next century.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Featured image of Alok Sharma by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bankofengland\/49591961028\/in\/photolist-2ip1ew4-2ip4Ms6-2ifGaUJ-2ip2m8b-2ip4L6Z-2ip4L7F-2ip16PW-2iygLfQ-2ip3Cd5-2iynem2-2iykX31-2iygLda-2iyjsDz-bLq5E2-2ifJtc3-2ifKCSz-2ifJzHz-2ifGaBQ-2ifJzMN-2ifJzPX-2ifJzS7-2ifJt9N-2ifJt7D-2ifGaNX-2ifGaKW-2iHeUJ6-2ifKD9w-2ifGaT1-2ifKDcs-2ifJzXH-2ifJzUS-2ifGaQR-2ifKw9e-2ifJtb1-2ifJt8A-2ifG45m-2gTnH1h\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of England<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/cop26-postponed-what-does-this-mean-for-the-climate-crisis\/"},"Page 36":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/energy\">Energy<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Digital Sobriety: How the Internet is Harming the Environment<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/florenne-earle-ledger\/\">Florenne Earle Ledger<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <\/span><span>Mar 2nd 2020<\/span><span>4 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Digital Sobriety: How the Internet is Harming the Environment\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Webp.net-resizeimage-12-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Digital Sobriety: How the Internet is Harming the Environment\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Webp.net-resizeimage-12-1.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><b>International treaties such as The Paris Agreement commits governments to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

For example, the \u2018autoplay\u2019 functionality on Netflix encourages the user to watch more episodes than they would have intended, as there is little time to opt out before the next episode starts playing. Consumers need to be aware of how website design can influence them to spend more time online than is necessary.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Shift Project asserts that \u2018regulation by content\u2019 is needed, which \u2018<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would aim at redimensioning the design of platforms to orient behaviours to a more precise selection of the content consumed. It would reduce the volume of content consumed and be more consistent with the user\u2019s needs\u2019.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This approach makes it possible to act directly on the product consumed- video content- and therefore adapt regulatory tools to its specific characteristics.

Gamers under 18 are now barred from playing online games between 10pm and 8am and during the week, minors are allowed to play for 90 minutes a day, an allotment that extends to three hours on weekends and public holidays. While it is too early to ascertain if this is a beneficial move, it may encourage game makers, and website designers broadly, to reduce their use of addictive design mechanisms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, no broad legislative action has been taken as most laws and political discussion surrounding the Internet concern data protection. There are difficulties in regulating content on the internet, as this would require an examination on the implications in terms of freedom of expression and the accessibility of contents, which raises the question of Net Neutrality.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are certainly challenges in reducing the carbon footprint of digital technologies, especially when considering the ethical aspects, as well as the practical aspects regarding increasing global access to the internet and an increasing population, there needs to be more consideration of how these technologies are impacting on the planet.

In 2003, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS) outbreak lasted for four months and affected more than 8 000 people around the world, killing 774. Researchers found that the vector of the virus was horseshoe bats which are common in the Yunnan province in China.

Dry seasons followed by heavy rainfalls that produce an abundance of fruits have coincided with outbreaks. When fruit is plentiful, bats and apes may gather together to eat, providing opportunities for the disease to be transmitted between species. Research has also showed that half of the Ebola outbreaks are directly linked to bush meat consumption.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><strong>Timeline: History of Disease<\/strong><\/p><div

Macroalgae, such as seaweed, is known to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fmars.2019.00265\/full\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poison<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> corals and reduce or halt the settlement and survival of juvenile corals. Herbivorous fish, such as parrotfish and surgeonfish, reduce or eliminate macroalgae from coral reefs and facilitate the growth of reef corals. Increasing the diversity of herbivorous fish and other functional groups of fish can therefore indirectly drive coral reef recovery.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studying the trajectory of algal growth over time allows researchers to determine the success or failure of strategies to manage herbivory or other factors that contribute to algal growth and the success of reef corals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While coral animals are incredibly fragile (just one knock from the fin of a careless diver or snorkeller could cause coral breakage that takes many months, or even years, to recover from), they have proven to be resilient; healthy coral that is free from stress has a better chance of recovery, whereas coral that experiences stress will recover slowly, if at all.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, while coral cover in Bonaire, an island in the Caribbean, suffered extensive damage following a hurricane and a coral bleaching event, corals have <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.edf.org\/edfish\/2019\/10\/31\/how-can-coral-reef-ecosystems-be-resilient-to-climate-change\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recovered<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to pre-bleaching levels less than a decade later due to effective resilience management.<\/span><\/p><p><strong>Sustainable Management of Coral Reefs<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several factors contributed to its management success. The island developed its diving and hotel industries early and they have become Bonaire\u2019s economic engine, above industries such as fishing. Additionally, the most economically valued fishing targeted fish other than coral reef dwelling fish. These factors mean that relatively few people in Bonaire depend on reef fish for food, allowing the fish to thrive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While addressing global threats poses a huge challenge, there are many things that can be done on a grassroots level. Therefore, focusing on reducing these direct threats- which can make corals more vulnerable to larger-scale stressors- is key.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reef-world.org\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Reef-World Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a conservation NGO aiming to do just that by improving environmental practices across the marine tourism industry. The charity coordinates the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/greenfins.net\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green Fins<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> initiative globally in partnership with the UN Environment Programme.

Not only does this type of well-managed tourism protect coral reefs- leaving them healthier, more resilient to climate change impacts and more effective at their ecosystem services- but also presents an economic opportunity, creating food and sustainable employment for millions of people around the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sam Craven, Programmes Manager at Reef-World, has been involved in the implementation of the initiative for many years. Achieving conservation impact, for Sam and her team, is all about collaboration; whether that be with governments, marine tourism operators or individual dive guides and tourists. She explains: \u201cMore often than not, marine conservation is less about \u2018saving the sea\u2019 and more about managing people\u2019s impact on the sea.\u201d She continues: \u201cScience alone doesn\u2019t change the world; it\u2019s how you use it that counts.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Climate change-related coral mortality is unavoidable, but <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fmars.2019.00265\/full\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">local management actions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can improve conditions for regrowth and rehabilitation.

Experts say stillbirth occurrences are higher among disadvantaged, marginalised and rural populations. In Ghana, these births are largely due to exposure to either industrial or household smoke. Many people are unaware of the effects of this smoke on their health; it is a byproduct of their work, passed down from generation to generation.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a paper published in the BMJ 2019 and the 2007 Ghana Maternal Health Survey, the situation is affecting many pregnant women in Ghana due to ignorance and a lack of data to prove the impact of the harm caused. Lead author of the paper, Dr Kofi Amega, Environmental Epidemiologist at the University of Cape Coast in Ghana says, \u201cThe issue here is that most women who are vulnerable to the exposure don\u2019t even know they are being affected simply because there is no data or physical evidence for them to see until they are sick.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><strong>What can be done?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr Amega and his team are optimistic that an investment into the provision of liquefied petroleum gas at an affordable rate will help solve the problem in the short term. In the long term, the team says that the country\u2019s transport sector needs to properly manage the number of vehicles on the roads and get the public transport system up on its feet to address the situation.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr Judith Addo- Quansah, Physician Specialist at the Korlebu Teaching Hospital in Accra<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, echoes this view and adds that there is little information on how these biomass fuels are used in Ghana.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a dire need for more concrete data on the effects of biomass fuel burning; not just on the environment, but on the people who have to live with the effects.

There should be more information made available to the public that outlines how best to use these fuels.

Farmers can employ strategies such as floating cultivation, crop rotation and seasonal water management. Ultimately, states should begin to invest in programmes involving a managed retreat for rural coastline residents. States must facilitate these migrations by incentivising people to move early. Governments can expand public transportation between inland and coastal settlements, so that individuals who move inland can continue to work on the coast for as long as possible, or vice versa. Delaying relocation until the conditions become untenable can be traumatic for communities and local economies. A comprehensive managed retreat programme can be the most efficient way for communities to maintain economic output over time.<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/sea-level-rise-west-africa-is-sinking\/"},"Page 43":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/biodiversity\">Biodiversity<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Fire Is Not the Only Threat Amazon Forest Faces<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/felix-leung\/\">Felix Leung<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <\/span><span>Sep 4th 2019<\/span><span>3 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Fire Is Not the Only Threat Amazon Forest Faces\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/greenpeace_1000_667_80.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Fire Is Not the Only Threat Amazon Forest Faces\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/greenpeace_1000_667_80.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><b>Deforestation rates in the Amazon, the world\u2019s largest rainforest, hit the highest level last month since the current monitoring system began in 2015.\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p><b>\u2014<\/b><\/p><p><strong>The Amazon Rainforest Fire<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>T<\/strong>he<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/raging-wildfires-in-the-amazon-send-a-planetary-warning\/\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">raging wildfires that have been consuming vast tracts of woodlands<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the Amazon rainforest raised unprecedented concerns among political leaders and environmentally conscious citizens worldwide.

It can also contribute to mitigation and adaptation,\u201d says the report. \u201cReducing and reversing land degradation, at scales from individual farms to entire watersheds, can provide cost-effective, immediate, and long-term benefits to communities and support several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with co-benefits for adaptation and mitigation.\u201d\u00a0<\/p><p>Reducing food waste is another important solution. The report estimates that over 30% of food is lost or wasted, which has environmental costs as food waste accounts for upward of 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. If the world were to drastically limit food waste, farmers would need less land, less fuel, less water, and less fertiliser, all of which would translate to a smaller environmental footprint. \u201cTechnical options such as improved harvesting techniques, on-farm storage, infrastructure, transport, packaging, retail, and education can reduce food loss and waste across the supply chain,\u201d the report states. \u201cBy 2050, reduced food loss and waste can free millions of square kilometers of land.\u201d<\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/new-un-report-warns-climate-change-could-trigger-global-food-crisis\/"},"Page 45":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/oceans\">Oceans<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Shrinking Ice Sheet in Greenland May Accelerate Global Climate Crisis<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/rahoof\/\">Abdul Rahoof K K<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <\/span><span>Jul 8th 2019<\/span><span>4 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Shrinking Ice Sheet in Greenland May Accelerate Global Climate Crisis\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/photo-1461880234904-751a2f54f1c7-1024x683.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Shrinking Ice Sheet in Greenland May Accelerate Global Climate Crisis\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/photo-1461880234904-751a2f54f1c7-1024x683.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><h3><strong>Greenland is the world\u2019s largest island with a vast body of ice sheet covering 1,710,000 sq km, roughly 80% of the surface.

At deeper depths, around half of the ocean\u2019s seafloor would have become completely oxygen-free.<\/p><p>How would contemporary species cope with such a dramatic turnaround? Researchers measured the oxygen and temperature sensitivities of 61 marine animals \u2013 including corals crustaceans, fish, shellfish and sharks.<\/p><p>Their tolerance to high temperature and low oxygen is remarkably similar to their Permian counterparts, as they had evolved under similar pre-cataclysmic environmental conditions.<\/p><p>Geographically, the organisms hardest hit by oxygen changes were those located in cooler waters. While many species that lived in the tropics also went extinct in the model, those at the poles were almost completely wiped out.<\/p><p>\u201cVery few marine organisms stayed in the same habitats they were living in \u2013 it was either flee or perish,\u201d said Curtis Deutsch from the University of Washington.<\/p><p>To verify the findings, Jonathan Payne and Erike Sperling from Stanford University analysed late-Permian fossil distributions from an archive of published fossil collections. Fossil records, which include data species\u2019 geographical distribution before and after the cataclysmic upheavals, confirm that species far from the equator suffered most during the event.<\/p><p>\u201cSince tropical organisms\u2019 metabolisms were already adapted to fairly warm, lower-oxygen conditions, they could move away from the tropics and find the same conditions somewhere else,\u201d Deutsch said. \u201cBut if an organism was adapted for a cold, oxygen-rich environment, then those conditions ceased to exist in the shallow oceans.\u201d<\/p><p>It took millions of years for the biosphere to regenerate and diversify.<\/p><p>While global warming leading to <strong>insufficient oxygen <\/strong>was the cause of over 50% of the marine diversity losses, the authors believe that other changes, such as <strong>ocean acidification <\/strong>or shifts in the <strong>productivity of photosynthetic organisms<\/strong>, are likely contributing factors.<\/p><p>The study\u2019s conclusions hold a cautionary tale. The calamitous shocks that upended life on Earth in the Permian period were steeper and more dramatic than those we are currently witnessing with man-made global warming. Yet, rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to warmer temperatures mimic \u2013 albeit at a slower pace \u2013 the remote past.<\/p><p>\u201cUnder a business-as-usual emissions scenarios, by 2100 warming in the upper ocean will have approached 20% of warming in the late Permian, and by the year 2300 it will reach between 35 \u2013 50%,\u201d said Penn.<\/p><p>\u201cThis study highlights the potential for the sixth mass extinction arising from a similar mechanism under anthropogenic climate change.\u201d<\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><strong>References:<\/strong><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.aat1327\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">J.

However, because of lack of winter storms and record high temperatures in winter, snowpack has been at an all-time low, threatening hydropower supply as well. When surface water supplies are low, groundwater is drilled to make up for the shortfall. However, these aquifers are being rapidly depleted to make up for the shortfalls in surface water supply. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.watereducation.org\/photo-gallery\/california-water-101#:~:text=California%20depends%20on%20two%20sources,These%20are%20called%20aquifers.\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">85% of Californians depend on groundwater for at least part of their drinking water<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which sank up to 60cm during the recent drought.

Soils burned severely can lose the ability to absorb water for a few years after being burned.

Currently, over 800 million people are suffering from severe malnutrition, a shocking thought when one third of all the food that is intended for human consumption is wasted or lost.

It is therefore imperative that we reduce the amount of food wasted around the world; the failure to do so will cause a humanitarian crisis not seen before on this scale.<\/span><\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/countries-that-waste-the-most-food\/"},"Page 3":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Ivy Is Flourishing In European Forests Due To Rising Temperatures<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/alex-coughlan\/\">Alex Coughlan<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <\/span><span>Jan 6th 2021<\/span><span>3 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Ivy Is Flourishing In European Forests Due To Rising Temperatures\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/rsz_ivy-413686_1280.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Ivy Is Flourishing In European Forests Due To Rising Temperatures\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/rsz_ivy-413686_1280.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>Global warming is accelerating the spread of ivy in Europe\u2019s deciduous forests, a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/environment\/ivy-trees-europe-climate-change-b1765149.html\" target=\"_blank\">study<\/a> has found.

During its first ten years of life, it grows away from the sun in search of a shady host plant, displaying a behaviour called \u2018negative phototropism\u2019. Thus, in temperate forests, juvenile ivy often begins climbing on the sunny southern face of trees, before gradually reaching around, away from the light, and growing predominantly on the darker northern side.

The team, led by Dr Michael Perring, surveyed almost 2 000 plots within 40 temperate forest regions across Europe, assessing around 1 000 plant species \u2013 including lianas, the family of climbers to which ivy belongs. Their observations were compared with historical data from two rounds of surveys, conducted at the same plots between 1933-94 and 1987-2015 respectively. The average duration between the first survey and the follow-up survey at a given site was 38 years.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their findings indicated that ivy had become, on average, 14% more prevalent over a 38-year period, its range extending by nearly 3% each year. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/environment\/ivy-trees-europe-climate-change-b1765149.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr Perring<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> says, \u201cWhat we have done is highlight, to my knowledge for the first time in temperate, rather than tropical areas, the large geographic extent of this ivy spread in the understorey. What is also really marked is that no other species exhibits such a geographically coherent pattern of increase \u2014 this is really quite striking.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The findings also suggested that global warming was a major factor behind ivy\u2019s increased profusion. \u201cThere was a much higher probability of finding ivy at a resurvey where it was absent initially where there had been a greater rate of warming,\u201d said Dr Perring. While rising air temperatures appear to be the primary cause of the plant\u2019s accelerated growth, there may also be secondary factors, such as the management strategies employed in certain woodlands, or increased amounts of shade due to the presence of more or older trees.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ecological implications of ivy\u2019s proliferation are both positive and negative. An abundance of ivy means more food and shelter for birds and insects, especially during winter, as well as increased biomass accumulation and nutrient cycling in the understory, and, due to its evergreen nature, an extended period of carbon sequestration for temperate woodlands. On the other hand, trees are more vulnerable to windfall if large tangles of ivy converge in the canopy, and the chemicals released by ivy leaf litter can hinder the growth of seedlings (a phenomenon known as allelopathy), thereby disrupting forest regeneration.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In light of such threats, ivy\u2019s quickening expansion should be monitored in order to protect other plant species and preserve ecosystem health. In addition, given the newly-discovered correlation between rising air temperatures and accelerated ivy growth, the speed of the creeper\u2019s advancement across temperate forests could serve as a useful indicator for the rate of global warming.<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/ivy-flourishing-in-european-forests-due-to-rising-temperatures\/"},"Page 4":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Top 16 of Best Environmental Films of 2020<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/charmaine-kong\/\">Charmaine Kong<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Dec 24th 2020<\/span><span>7 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Top 16 of Best Environmental Films of 2020\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/49449072528_1876ce3416_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Top 16 of Best Environmental Films of 2020\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/49449072528_1876ce3416_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>Environmental issues have proved themselves to be an increasingly hot subject in film and television.

As the UN\u2019s Executive Secretary and Chief Political Strategist respectively, the two played central roles in the historic Paris Agreement of 2015, widely recognised as the most substantial step towards staving off runaway climate change since talks began. Entering a space of decided hopelessness, they banded together to create what they call a \u2018contagious frame of mind that led to collective wisdom\u2019. It is this frame of mind that takes central focus in their new book <i>The Future We Choose<\/i>.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><em><b>T<\/b>he Future We Choose<\/em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0a guidebook for climate activism and active participation. It also functions, in a way, as a kind of climate self-help book for the many who feel crushed under the \u2018fatal knowledge\u2019 of everything to come. In this way, their book fills a large but closing gap in the climate narrative, where hopelessness and incapacitating nihilism have the monopoly. Yet it is to the authors\u2019 credit that the story of optimism and hope that they tell is not a whitewashed or reductive one. The book does not turn a blind eye to the true, horrifying depths of the crisis. They instead show that a gritty, grounded optimism is always available to us, even as we look at the crisis dead-on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one of the best sections of <em>The Future We Choose<\/em>, the authors present two contrasting narrative styles: one chapter fearful and alarmist, the next hopeful. The friction between these two chapters works well to underline a key point that we are still\u2014though barely\u2014inside the window of time in which we have relative agency over our climate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change-linked-to-antibiotic-resistance\/\" target=\"_blank\">Climate Change Potentially Linked to Rising Antibiotic Resistance- Study<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First is a portrait of a 2050 world in which we have failed to halt global emissions. This means that we are on track for 3 or 4 degrees of warming beyond pre-industrial levels. In this world, \u2018The first thing that hits you is the air.\u2019 It is hot and heavy, and your \u2018cough never seems to disappear.\u2019 With the carbon sinks of the world utterly ravaged, \u2018Tipping point after tipping point is being reached.\u2019 Countries the world-over suffer \u2018brutal infrastructure destructions.\u2019 Every day, \u2018some new part of the world must evacuate to higher ground\u2019 due to rising seas. Some cities are on the verge of desertification. Mass migrations are everywhere to see since the equatorial band became largely uninhabitable. There is, everywhere, \u2018a sense of bottomless loss, unbearable guilt and fierce resentment at previous generations who didn\u2019t do what was necessary to ward off this unstoppable calamity.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This first fearful chapter echoes the zeitgeist of climate storytelling today: stories of doom and portents of a world that science says we are bound for. And, of course, it is a story that bears repeating. But it is at this point that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Future We Choose<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> makes a crucial manoeuvre, taking a speculative glance at a very different 2050. In the next chapter, we find a portrait of a world in which we all did what we had to do in order to stave off catastrophe. Here, the air is very different. It is \u2018moist and fresh, even in cities.\u2019 In many places, \u2018it feels a lot like walking through a forest.\u2019 This is due to drastic plunges in air pollution, massive rewilding projects and a \u2018complete reimagining of cities.\u2019 The chapter documents, in riveting detail, the \u2018excitement and innovation of the new climate economy\u2019 in which we no longer recklessly burn fossil fuels, and in which renewable energy has created millions of jobs and an abundance of energy. \u2018The wide-ranging transition to renewable energy was at times uncomfortable,\u2019 they say, \u2018yet we finally saw that transition for what it was\u2014the tantalising opportunity to reimagine the way we live on and interact with the planet. When alarm bells rang in 2020 \u2026 we realised that we suffered from too much consumption. But humanity was only ever as doomed as it believed itself to be. Vanquishing that belief was our true legacy.\u2019<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This key early sequence in the book underlines the value of holding both worlds in our hands; alarm and grief in one and hope and forward-thinkingness in the other. Indeed, the friction between these two visions of the future casts as wide a net as possible for readers. The story of alarm and horror reminds us of the urgent need for action, while the story of hope\u2013an uplifting vision which is like a hook in the future\u2013awakens the creativity and energy required for such transformational change. We should, Figueres and Rivett-Carnac say, take adequate time to grieve, but that heartbreak that we feel \u2018should spur us onto greater action rather than sink us into a pit of blame [or] despair.\u2019 Gearing our collective mindsets away from climate despair towards a more regenerative point of view will, the authors suggest, be the first crucial step towards meaningful change.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Figueres and Rivett-Carnac dub this philosophy \u2018Stubborn Optimism.\u2019 They define it as a gritty, realistic mindset that exists not because success is necessarily likely, but because failure is simply unthinkable. After 30 years of climate reporting, we all have learned responses of hopelessness. Yet it is possible to deliberately reprogramme ourselves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We might believe, rather gravely, that it is too late to change course. But remember, the authors say, that \u2018every fraction of warming makes a difference\u2019 and that \u2018any reduction lessens the burden on the future.\u2019 We might feel that it is all just too depressing to look at. The authors say that we should remind ourselves that \u2018mobilising for generational change can be thrilling,\u2019 that we have \u2018the outrageous fortune to be here on this planet at a moment of profound consequence,\u2019 when we can still change course. Or we might be convinced of the impossibility of lightening society\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels. But keep in mind, they say, that 50% of energy in the UK already comes from power sources other than fossil fuels, that Costa Rica is almost 100% renewable, that companies including Amazon have pledged carbon-neutrality by 2050, and that China, the world\u2019s largest emitter, has pledged the same by before 2060. We might be firm in our belief that it is surely impossible to shift the tide of public indifference. However historically, only as little as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/future\/article\/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.5% of a population has ever needed to mobilise<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> non-violently to bring into effect transformative societal change, and polling shows that a majority of people now understand the climate crisis to be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/guardian-vice-poll-finds-most-us-2020-voters-strongly-favour-climate-action\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">among the defining issues of our time<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such is the exciting, regenerative attitude that Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac provide in <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Future We Choose<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It is a narrative of hope that is under appreciated in climate storytelling. Yet the book never allows for this optimism to eclipse the real, tragic losses of the Anthropocene, nor does it fail to tell this story without the required urgency.

We will see.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During President Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, he managed to get China to support broad policies to slow the growth in greenhouse gases and shift the Chinese economy toward renewable sources of energy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cordial US-China relationship depends on the results of the US presidential election, with a potential Biden presidency looking to re-engage with China on the climate crisis. However, the MoFA\u2019s tone in these documents is concerning. Following China\u2019s surprise announcement that it will aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, this could be seen as MoFA\u2019s attempt to capitalise on the reputational gains of it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/cornstalker\/24057953985\/in\/photolist-CDViy6-C6qaRX-2ivMCjx-2ivRjG9-2ivMCA9-2ivRjZ8-2ivMC47-2ivQbRk-2ivQcBP-2ivQcEp-2ivQcjV-2ivQcnk-2ivRk3j-2ivRkn7-2ivRkC7-2ivQcr8-2ivQceV-2ivLUom-2jf3mUs-2jf3mf6-2jf3mbo-2jf7wVF-2jf3nid-2jf3m8T-2jf3mA1-2jf3n8o-2jf3mDY-2jf6djo-2jf3mRw-2jf3mqS-2jf6cBb-2jf6cQn-2jf7xgf-NbmGeu-2jKVuFG-2jKVwhc-2jKRXeb-2jKRWs6-2jKRYJA-2jKVwp6-2jKRY9x-2jKVwzB-2jKVvKq-2jKRWR7-2jKRUXC-2jKRXFd-2jKVwKB-2jKVy4t-2hzZrF6-2hzWDAb\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr\u00a0<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/china-criticises-us-on-climate-policies\/"},"Page 11":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/policy-and-economics\">Policy &amp; Economics<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Europe\u2019s Post-COVID-19 Green Recovery Plans Should Serve as Inspiration to Others<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <\/span><span>Oct 19th 2020<\/span><span>4 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Europe\u2019s Post-COVID-19 Green Recovery Plans Should Serve as Inspiration to Others\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/50060836567_5d1c4d1cab_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Europe\u2019s Post-COVID-19 Green Recovery Plans Should Serve as Inspiration to Others\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/50060836567_5d1c4d1cab_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on lives and economies around the world.

Specifically, it aims for a 50% reduction in pesticides and antimicrobials, a 20% reduction in fertiliser use, a 50% reduction in food waste, a shift to healthier diets, improvements to fisheries management and aquaculture. However, care should be taken to enhance overall agricultural productivity to avoid the need to convert natural ecosystems to farms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, the stimulus package would support workers and communities affected by this energy transition by investing $44 billion in the EU\u2019s Just Transition Fund.

The film traces his 60-year career, outlining how steeply the health of the planet has declined in his lifetime. It also makes grim predictions for the future should humanity continue on its current path, predictions that Earth.Org has covered extensively. Here are some of the key takeaways and predictions from Life on Our Planet.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A<\/strong>ttenborough maps out how humanity\u2019s wanton destruction of nature will render the planet totally degraded and barren, uninhabitable for millions of people and bringing biodiversity populations crashing. Since the 1950s, animal populations have more than halved, while domestic birds\u2019 populations have skyrocketed; 70% of the mass of the birds on the planet are domestic birds- mostly chickens. Humans account for over one-third of the weight of mammals on Earth. A further 60% of animals are those that are raised for us to eat. The rest- \u201cfrom mice to whales\u201d- make up just 4%. Domestic animals require vast swathes of land and half of the fertile land on the planet is now farmland.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humans cut down up to 15 billion trees per year; this is just one facet of the planet\u2019s degradation thanks to humans, which has resulted in 30% of fish stocks being fished to critical levels and freshwater populations declining by over 80%. The Arctic, one of the coldest and remote places on Earth, has experienced summer sea ice reducing by 40% in 40 years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Attenborough makes horrifying predictions for the 2030s, 2040s, 2050s, 2080s and 2100s:<\/span><\/p><p><b>2030s<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With continued deforestation of the Amazon rainforest, it will degrade to a point where it can no longer produce enough moisture, transforming into a dry savanna. Not only will this decimate the biodiversity in the rainforest, but it will also alter the global water cycle.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/the-amazon-at-risk-of-drying-out\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Amazon is at Risk of Drying Out<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Arctic will start experiencing ice-free summers. Without the white ice caps, less of the sun\u2019s energy will be reflected back into space. This will accelerate global warming.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>2040s<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the North, frozen permafrost soils will thaw, releasing methane into the atmosphere, a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/methane-emissions-in-the-arctic-could-amplify-global-warming\/\" target=\"_blank\">Methane Emissions in the Arctic Could Amplify Global Warming<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><b>2050s<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As oceans continue to heat and become more acidic, coral reefs around the world will bleach and die.

Scientists predict that the sixth mass extinction will be well underway at this point, causing irreversible damage to the planet. The security and stability of the Holocene era- our \u201cGarden of Eden,\u201d as Attenborough calls it, will be lost.<\/span><\/p><p><strong>Solutions<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All hope is not lost however, David Attenborough asserts. We still have time to halt and even reverse the damage we have caused to the planet. The film lays out several fairly simply and feasible solutions, including:<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We need to slow the rate at which the global population is growing; by 2100, the population is expected to reach 11 billion people. To slow the population growth rate, we need to raise people out of poverty, improve access to healthcare globally and enable children, especially girls, to stay in school for as long as possible.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We need to shift to renewable energy, a process which is already happening at a rapid- albeit not rapid enough- pace. At the turn of the century, Morocco relied on imported oil and gas for almost all of its energy. Today, it generates 40% of its needs at home from renewable sources, boasting the world\u2019s largest solar farm. With its rapid advancements in this area, Morocco could be an energy exported by 2050. Globally, renewable energy may be the dominant source of energy in 20 years. David Attenborough calls for divestment from fossil fuels, and points out the irony of banks and investment firms investing pension funds in fossil fuels when it\u2019s these dirty fuels preventing the future that we are saving for.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We need to restore-or \u201crewild\u201d- biodiversity on the planet. When ecosystems are more diverse, they are better able to perform essential ecosystem services, like carbon sequestration. An example of this is the oceans. Palau is a western Pacific island nation dependent on its oceans for food and tourism. When fishing stocks were rapidly depleting, the government restricted fishing practices and banned fishing entirely in some areas. The protected fish populations soon became so healthy that they spilled into areas where fishing was allowed. These no-fish zones resulted in increased catches for fishermen and recovered coral reefs. Globally, if no-fish zones were implemented over a third of the world\u2019s oceans, we would have all the fish we would need. The UN is trying to do just that- create the largest no-fish zone in international waters.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, we need to reduce the space we use for farmland to instead make space for returning wilderness. The easiest way to do this is to change our diets. If we all had a largely plant-based diet, David Attenborough says, we would need half the land we use now. In nature, large carnivores are fairly rare; for every predator on the Serengeti, there are more than 100 prey animals. The Netherlands is one of the world\u2019s most densely populated countries. This has forced Dutch farmers to use land much more efficiently. Through creative and innovative changes to farming practices, in two generations, the nation has raised yields tenfold while using less water, fewer pesticides and fertilisers and emitting less carbon. Today, the Netherlands is the world\u2019s second largest exporter of food.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, we need to halt deforestation as forests are the planet\u2019s biggest ally in locking away carbon. Further, forests must be more biodiverse as this will make them more effective at absorbing carbon. Crops like oil palm and soya should only be grown on land that was deforested long ago. The example of Costa Rica is used. A century ago, more than three-quarters of the nation was covered with forest. By the 1980s, thanks to rampant deforestation, this was reduced to one quarter. The government intervened, giving grants to landowners to replant native trees. Thanks to this initiative, forests now cover half of Costa Rica once more.<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/how-costa-rica-reversed-deforestation\/\" target=\"_blank\">How Costa Rica Reversed Deforestation and Became an Environmental Model<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem is immense, but we already have the knowledge and skills to halt and reverse it. We need to reexamine our relationship with nature, working with it instead of against it, to restore our planet to its former glory.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/imfphoto\/40621415353\/in\/photolist-24Tznye-2e7gjfi-24TAxhv-TmUjE1-2epaNgC-2fvapLv-2epc5CU-2epc5FE-24TAxnF-2fJpfuQ-2idnr6o-7DgFZP-8Qp15a-2ge3xkB-24fHArS-7a795T-255DKtF-q6mbBG-2fJped1-8QrZAC-a6gUjn-288AVxx-AwYBtb-fLZANT-2gXtmy3-aDxqWb-294jMGb-271dSF3-6nYsGP-65djCq-65djS1-6593m8-65djps-65939P-9JVmmm-9JSwcT-2hkMofo-2gVyKFi-8gxhAn-2gz1FLN-2i2pptK-6593A4-HCGJX-a3xCpx-Kv847B-MvBDcQ-271dV2q-2fhwyAw-9JVmsN-9JSwFr\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/david-attenborough-new-film-a-life-on-our-planet\/"},"Page 13":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/policy-and-economics\">Policy &amp; Economics<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Floods in Sudan Have Shone a Light on its Vulnerability to the Climate Crisis<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <\/span><span>Oct 2nd 2020<\/span><span>4 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Floods in Sudan Have Shone a Light on its Vulnerability to the Climate Crisis\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/31443090261_f07206fee5_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Floods in Sudan Have Shone a Light on its Vulnerability to the Climate Crisis\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/31443090261_f07206fee5_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>In recent weeks, Sudan has experienced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2020\/9\/25\/over-800000-affected-in-sudan-flooding-un\" target=\"_blank\">flooding and landslides<\/a> triggered by torrential downpours that have not only affected nearly 830 000 people and destroyed thousands of homes, but also damaged large tracts of farmland just before harvest.

Would clamping down on these short-lived gases result in faster emergence of climate mitigation benefits? Unfortunately, the scientists found that even though methane is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/environment\/global-warming\/methane\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">80 times more potent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than carbon dioxide on a 20-year timescale, reducing methane emissions to zero starting this year would only slow warming from 2039. Furthermore, while strong mitigation of short-lived climate forcers like black carbon (a component of particulate matter formed from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels) may see earlier emergence of climate mitigation benefits than carbon dioxide mitigation, the eventual accumulation of continued CO2 emissions is likely to offset these benefits in the near future. As phrased by the scientists, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-020-17001-1#:~:text=Previously%2C%20Tebaldi%20and%20Friedlingstein7,heavily%20mitigated%20emission%20pathway%20(RCP2.\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018targeting [black carbon] emissions\u2026 would be efficient- however, with a low final payoff\u2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these findings can be rather dismaying, mitigation still remains key to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. What is crucial now is to clearly communicate these scientific findings to the public to manage expectations and maintain support for mitigation policies along the years. While the scientists recommend using atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to assess the effectiveness of mitigation policies in order to remove the confounding effect of natural variability, temperature still remains the most intuitive indicator of climate change.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To illustrate the risk of insufficient scientific communication, if all greenhouse gas emissions were to be completely stopped starting this year, the public would expect immediate, rapid declines in global warming. However, temperatures are projected to rise at an accelerated pace for at least 13 more years. Without careful, nuanced media messaging to convey and explain this projection, the lack of immediate outcomes may lead to public backlash on the perceived ineffectiveness of the policies, and sustaining climate mitigation efforts in the long-run could be met with significant pushback.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, pushing for strong, sustained mitigation efforts to counter the climate crisis will require the collective cooperation between governments, the scientific community and the media.<\/span><\/p><p><em>Featured image by: <a class=\"owner-name truncate\" data-track=\"attributionNameClick\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/un_photo\/5410822714\/in\/photolist-9f8T5N-gut2X8-dWsubT-m2wmSD-KyS9h-2iJ1xwY-BG8MNG-2ipg6hw-N6Jhed-P9m3vJ-NjwFbz-2jAyM2E-mHNyt3-7m6NYk-2jaehM5-91cW17-RWveyC-qGjp2g-qfeprn-rBuTkE-QGNGMu-QKgEMk-qcXums-6dd48A-pifkSL-25oQJRT-pitAuK-AJKNCY-amCztB-ZksxdR-28Hp4ZX-mw8S3M-oM6sMt-gcjZkJ-4FMNkz-2ghE2t3-2ghE2B4-2ghEmh9-2ghDLmH-2ghDLjy-2ghEmg7-2ghEmgN-2ghDLka-2ghE2y3-2ghDLf5-2ghDLeU-2ghDLfa-2ghEmbT-2ghEm9P-Pb6RBX\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Go to United Nations Photo's photostream\">United Nations Photo<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/what-would-happen-to-the-climate-if-we-stopped-greenhouse-gas-emissions\/"},"Page 18":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Greenland Ice Sheet Lost 1 Million Tons of Ice Per Minute In 2019- Satellite Data<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Aug 21st 2020<\/span><span>2 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Greenland Ice Sheet Lost 1 Million Tons of Ice Per Minute In 2019- Satellite Data\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-08-21T120227.985.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Greenland Ice Sheet Lost 1 Million Tons of Ice Per Minute In 2019- Satellite Data\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-08-21T120227.985.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>According to satellite data, the Greenland ice sheet lost a record amount of ice in 2019: an average of a million tons per minute throughout the year. The climate crisis is heating the Arctic region at double the rate than at lower latitudes, and the Greenland ice sheet will be one of the biggest contributors to sea level rise, which is already affecting coastline cities around the world.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s43247-020-0010-1,\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>P<\/strong>ublished<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment, the research used data from NASA\u2019s Grace satellites, which take gravity measurement and essentially weigh the mass of ice in Greenland.

This, according to satellite data that has been collected since 2003, was more than double the annual average since then of 255 billion tons. Weather data and computer models allow for losses to be calculated back to 1948. Almost 96% of the ice sheet underwent melting at some point in 2019, compared with an average of 64% between 1981 and 2010. The researchers add that of record melt years, the top five has happened in the last 10 years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The researchers attributed this massive ice loss in 2019 to \u201cblocking patterns\u201d of weather that kept warm air over Greenland for longer, occurrences which are becoming more frequent as the climate crisis accelerates. This pattern also caused low snowfall, which means that little ice was added to the sheet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/releasing-herds-of-animals-into-the-arctic-could-help-fight-thawing-permafrost\/\" target=\"_blank\">Releasing Herds of Animals into the Arctic Could Help Fight Climate Change, Study Finds<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the researchers found that in 2017 and 2018, there was unusually low ice loss, as this block pattern was reversed. This led to cold, snowy conditions over Greenland. However, they stress that ice was still lost from the ice sheet, and that cold years do not make up for the hot ones.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ingo Sasgen of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, who led the analysis, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2020\/aug\/20\/greenland-ice-sheet-lost-a-record-1m-tonnes-of-ice-per-minute-in-2019\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201c2019 was really shocking and depressing in terms of the numbers. But it\u2019s also not very surprising, because we had other strong melt years in 2010 and 2012, and\u00a0 expect we will see more and more.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sasgen expresses further concern about feedback loop mechanisms that increase ice loss, like meltwater weakening the ice sheet and exacerbating its fall into the ocean. Warmer temperatures also melt the white snow on top of the sheet, revealing darker ice below, which absorbs more of the sun\u2019s heat.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the entire Greenland ice sheet melts, sea level would rise by six metres.

However, this blanket approach of labelling all migrating species under climate change as invasive, being extremely wary of their impact and being ready to eradicate at any second, is too simple for the effect that the climate crisis is having on ecosystems and the migratory response of many species. As these species shift their natural ranges into new territories, should we eradicate them? Under these rigid definitions, these species would be considered non-native, but some are likely to earn the badge of invasive as they pressure native flora or fauna.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a changing world, the terms\u2019 validity is questioned.

The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nwf.org\/Educational-Resources\/Wildlife-Guide\/Threats-to-Wildlife\/Invasive-Species\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Wildlife Foundation says<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that 42% of endangered or threatened species in the United States are at risk due to invasive species. The pattern that is observed is that unless the species is endangered, authorities and scientists are less likely to care about the alien species. This creates a hierarchy when it comes to conservation \u2013 the endangered-common species hierarchy \u2013 that circumvents the native-invasive classifications. If the rigid categorisation can be overruled by this hierarchy, then a classification based on different values, such as contributions to overall biodiversity or ecosystem service value, can replace it.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While introduced species that cause harm will, seemingly, always be labelled \u201cinvasive,\u201d the reception for \u201cnon-native species\u201d is warmer. Martin Schlaepfer, a conservation biologist at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, argues that non-native species often provide ecosystem services. He argues that there are some urban areas where non-native species make up almost half of local species, contributing extensively to biodiversity, citing examples of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0169204602001457?via=ihub\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berlin, Germany<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and across <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1046\/j.1365-2699.1998.251177.x\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">central Europe<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

As the school of thought changes, conservationists are increasingly distancing themselves from the restrictive terms, to consider the multiple benefits that new species provide.

The solution will always be dependent on subjective criteria based on what we find most valuable. Is nativeness enough to warrant the most protection, or do we look at biodiversity as a whole and the service value each species can contribute? With many species on the move due to climate change, is it time to put up the walls and keep all vulnerable, migrating species out or do we let nature take its course? In a system with which we have meddled so extensively, can we walk away from local ecosystems that need our intervention? It seems that even if the answers to these questions will never be unanimously decided, the awareness of the limitations and redundancy of \u201cinvasive,\u201d \u201cnon-native,\u201d \u201cnative\u201d and all the terms in between is making us rethink our attitudes towards conservation and to be more effective by thinking holistically with entire ecosystems and not at individual species level.<\/span><\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/how-relevant-is-the-native-vs-invasive-argument-in-warming-world\/"},"Page 20":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/oceans\">Oceans<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/policy-and-economics\">Policy &amp; Economics<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">An Increase in Coastal Flooding Threatens the Global Economy<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Aug 7th 2020<\/span><span>3 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"An Increase in Coastal Flooding Threatens the Global Economy\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/4971020016_1fa92b4e88_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"An Increase in Coastal Flooding Threatens the Global Economy\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/4971020016_1fa92b4e88_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-020-67736-6#Abs1\" target=\"_blank\">new study<\/a>, coastal flooding is set to rise by 52% throughout this century and threaten the global economy, risking assets worth 20% of global GDP, adding to concerns about how the climate crisis will affect the social and financial well being of the planet.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>How does global warming affect the economy?<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>T<\/strong>he study, conducted by the University of Melbourne and the University of East Anglia, found that climate change-induced sea level rise will significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding by 2100; flooding associated with a present day \u201c1 in 100-year event\u201d could occur as frequently as once in 10 years, primarily as a result of sea level rise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to estimate extreme sea levels throughout the century, the study looked at two scenarios of global warming, a high and moderate emissions scenario of global warming, which were added to present day extreme sea levels.

Even if we reduce our greenhouses gases today we\u2019ll still have significant flooding by 2100.

The site is 10 metres deep with a 70 metre long patch of white microbial mats.

The slow growth of microbes at the site means that methane is certainly leaking into the atmosphere.

Vast amounts of methane are thought to be stored under the sea floor around Antarctica which is released from frozen underwater stores or permafrost regions.

Animal farming and fossil fuels are the largest contributors to this increase, highlighting the need for mitigation in both these areas.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>T<\/strong>he team\u2019s findings come from the latest update to the Global Methane Budget, an international collaboration that estimates sources and sinks of methane around the world. The Budget says that since 2000, discharges of the greenhouse gas have risen more than 50 million tons a year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than half of the methane in the atmosphere now comes from human activities.

He says that human activities since the Industrial Revolution have increased the amount of methane in the atmosphere by 2.6 times, compared with 1.7 times for carbon dioxide. He adds that since methane is more potent than CO2, it should be a focus of efforts to cut emissions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCO2 is still the beast to slay but warming from methane is the next most important. Acting aggressively on methane can buy us time to address CO2 and shave half a degree off the peak temperature,\u201d he said. \u201cI am optimistic about opportunities to find methane super-emitters, using drones and satellites. But it is harder to cut emissions from a billion burping cows and a billion sheep, where dietary choices and manure management matter.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regionally, the biggest increases in the levels of methane- of 10 to 15 million tons a year- were in Asia, Africa and Oceania, largely due to farming. In the US, most of the 4.5 million ton rise over the past 10 years has been attributed to fracking and other forms of oil and gas drilling. Europe was the only continent to show a decline due to reductions in agricultural emissions. The Arctic also saw little change, suggesting that fears of methane being released from thawing permafrost had not been realised up to 2017.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The study found that methane sinks have increased, from around 546 billion tons in 2000-2006 to 571 billion tons in 2017. Methane stays in the atmosphere for an average of nine years and it is typically destroyed through chemical reactions that produce CO2 and water.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The authors have urged rapid action from governments to stabilise emissions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Global Methane Budget<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The global methane budget provides a way of tracking where methane emissions are coming from, how much is taken up through sinks and how much is left in the atmosphere. The budget is an initiative from the Global Carbon Project which aims to develop a complete picture of the global carbon cycle. The Project provides an annual update on global carbon emissions. However, researchers who work with the Project say that an annual update is more complicated for methane, whereby the scientific community is still \u2018finding its feet with the methane budget\u2019 and because it requires time-consuming model runs. As a result, the methane budget is updated every two to three years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/arctic-wildfires-set-a-pollution-record\/\" target=\"_blank\">This Year\u2019s Arctic Wildfires Have Set A Pollution Record<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p> <img alt=\"methane levels\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-16530 size-full\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/unnamed-8.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/unnamed-8.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/unnamed-8-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/unnamed-8-768x461.jpg 768w\" height=\"614\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20614'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"1024\"><noscript><img alt=\"methane levels\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-16530 size-full\" height=\"614\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/unnamed-8.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/unnamed-8.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/unnamed-8-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/unnamed-8-768x461.jpg 768w\" width=\"1024\"\/><\/noscript><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><figcaption><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The global methane budget for the year 2017 (Source: Jackson et al.

The water tower\u2019s vulnerability to future shocks include factors like hydro-political tension, government effectiveness, climate change, population change, baseline water stress and projected change in GDP. The quality and quantity of these freshwater supplies are essential to large populations, especially considering that<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.meco.com\/facts-about-water-scarcity\/\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">less than 1% of the earth\u2019s water<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is fit for human consumption.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Water towers most threatened with future scarcity primarily exist in Asia. The most relied-upon water tower is the Indus Basin, supplying water to India, China, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, nearly all important water towers in Asia, such as Amu Darya and Ganges-Brahmaputra, were found to be more vulnerable than mountains in other countries. This is because these regions tend to be transboundary, densely populated and have competing land use needs. Unfortunately, these factors are met with weak governance and geopolitical tension, amplified by the worsening effects of the climate crisis, leaving Asia\u2019s water towers in a highly vulnerable state.<\/span><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.circleofblue.org\/2018\/south-america\/water-access-in-lima-complicated-by-inequality-and-climate-uncertainty\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">South America\u2019s<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> water towers are just as vulnerable, more so than Europe and North America.

In fact, the Earth\u2019s oceans have absorbed around <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biogeosciences.net\/10\/2169\/2013\/bg-10-2169-2013.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one third of the carbon dioxide<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> produced by humans since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Yet, as surface waters warm they become more buoyant, preventing them from mixing with cold water found deeper in the ocean. This impacts the amount of carbon dioxide the ocean is able to absorb from the atmosphere as the mixing of surface and deeper waters allows the newly-absorbed carbon to sink and be replaced by cooler bottom water, which can absorb more carbon dioxide. As this mixing slows, uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide will decrease as the warm, gas-saturated surface water will be unable to continue absorbing carbon dioxide at the same rate, leading to higher concentrations in the atmosphere and increased oceanic warming.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to warming ocean temperatures, nutrient pollution of coastal environments through fertiliser run-off, sewage, animal waste and nitrogen deposition from the burning of fossil fuels promotes excessive algal growth in ocean surface water. After the algae die and their cells sink, bacteria breaks down the cells for energy in a process that consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide, leading to a further reduction in water oxygen levels and an increase in carbon dioxide. This process, known as eutrophication, in combination with warming ocean temperatures, results in an overall decrease in oceanic oxygen levels and in some cases the production of hypoxic zones, or \u2018Dead Zones\u2019: areas where dissolved oxygen levels are too low to support life. These Dead Zones impact on food web structures, biodiversity and potential fish yields.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, low-oxygen regions have the potential to release nitrous oxide and methane, two powerful greenhouse gasses, through their production in deoxygenated deep ocean waters that may then reach surface waters and be released to the atmosphere.\u00a0 The Gulf of Oman, the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Mexico are the three largest recurring Dead Zones in the world, with the Gulf of Oman totalling an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/environment\/dead-zone-arabian-sea-gulf-oman-underwater-robots-ocean-pollution-discovery-a8325676.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">area larger than that of Scotland<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while another <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/15\/5628\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has reported a growth of 55 000 km\u00b2 of the Baltic Sea Dead Zone over the last century.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/portals.iucn.org\/library\/node\/48892\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reports an overall 2% decline in the world\u2019s ocean oxygen levels since the 1950s, with a further predicted fall of 3-4% by 2100. This ocean deoxygenation will have serious consequences for biodiversity, commercial fishing and tourism in coastal regions. Large marine animals that require considerable amounts of oxygen, or hypoxia-sensitive animals, such as tuna, swordfish, and most other fish we eat, will be forced to surface waters or other areas of the ocean in search of higher oxygen levels, which may lead either to their overfishing or a severe disruption to commercial fishing. In contrast, hypoxia-tolerant species, such as microbes, jelly fish and some squid, will likely dominate most other species, leading to unsafe water and beach qualities, consequently influencing tourism worldwide.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><strong>Ocean Deoxygenation: Everyone\u2019s Problem<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ocean warming and deoxygenation is a problem that will have repercussions for everyone on the planet.

Carbon dioxide emissions must be urgently cut in order to mitigate ocean warming, as scientists predict recovery rates on the time scale of centuries under \u2018business as usual\u2019 emissions. Regulations to reduce nutrient run-off from both agriculture and sewage also need to be implemented to decrease the over-enrichment of coastal waters which leads to eutrophication.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/petahopkins\/15936247462\/\" target=\"_blank\">Peta Hopkins<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/ocean-deoxygenation\/"},"Page 38":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/biodiversity\">Biodiversity<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">What Shrinking Insect Populations Mean for the Planet<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/emily-folk\/\">Emily Folk<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <\/span><span>Jan 15th 2020<\/span><span>4 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"What Shrinking Insect Populations Mean for the Planet\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Webp.net-resizeimage-22-1024x683.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"What Shrinking Insect Populations Mean for the Planet\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Webp.net-resizeimage-22-1024x683.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><b>A study of global insect populations has revealed that <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006320718313636\" target=\"_blank\"><b>40% of the world\u2019s insect species<\/b><\/a><b> are threatened with extinction.

The planting of exotic trees along riverbanks has further diminished the diversity of dragonfly species. As foreign animals adapt to a new environment, they often bring a cascade of adverse effects for the native ones. The invasive species may prey on the native ones and further their shrinking numbers, or they can bring more invaders, turning the ecosystem on its head.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New plants can spring up when native bugs aren\u2019t there to eat them. A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/gcb.13093\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of invasive plants revealed that they have reducing effects of 56% on animal abundance, diversity, fitness and ecosystem function across different ecosystems, animal classes and feeding types with no increasing effects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><strong>What We Can Do<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insect-saving initiatives exist across the world for bees, butterflies and numerous other affected creatures. Homes can be made more insect-friendly through the creation of pollination gardens or the establishment of ponds for aquatic bugs. Agrochemicals like pesticides or synthetic fertilisers should be avoided. The innards of a dead tree can serve as bee habitats and on a community level, parks and community gardens should be advocated for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Governments can help prevent insect decline as well.

Much of the rest will go toward protecting insect habitats, decreasing disruptive light pollution and phasing out the use of the world\u2019s most popular weedkiller, glyphosate- better known as Roundup- which often kills the native plants that insects need for survival. The United Nations has also called on governments around the world<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/europa.eu\/capacity4dev\/unep\/blog\/more-190-governments-prepare-take-tough-decisions-stop-biodiversity-decline-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to stop biodiversity loss<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by protecting critical habitats and restoring damaged ecosystems.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practical countermeasures can halt an insect extinction before it\u2019s too late.

From July 30 to August 3, melting occurred across 90% of the continent\u2019s surface, dumping 55 billion tonnes of water over 5 days.

The rate of ice loss has risen from 33 billion tonnes a year in the 1990s to 254 billion tonnes a year in the last decade. The IPCC has estimated that global sea levels could rise by 60cm by 2100, putting 360 million people at risk of annual coastal flooding.

According to Wang et. al\u2019s study, high levels of desertification occurred in the 1970s, and from the early 2000s to the present, rehabilitation has occurred in most regions of arid Asia, especially in China.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To optimise these afforestation programmes, a study conducted by Lu et. al in 2015 suggested choosing species of plants with the maximum water-use efficiency that could alleviate the conflict between environmental water needs and human needs. Specifically, project managers should seek to restore the natural grassland vegetation in arid and semiarid areas. However, this may prove difficult in afforestation areas where trees have already lowered the water table to the point where the vegetation will struggle to survive. The study also notes the importance of developing optimised groundwater use schemes to use the resource sustainably.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another strategy that China has employed in controlling desertification includes the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/I-B_Lee\/publication\/248568730_Principles_of_sand_dune_fixation_with_straw_checkerboard_technology_and_its_effects_on_the_environment\/links\/59f6793d0f7e9b553ebd2ba6\/Principles-of-sand-dune-fixation-with-straw-checkerboar\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">straw checkerboard method<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, used for fixing sand dunes. Straws of wheat, rice, reeds, and other materials are placed in the shape of a checkerboard. Half is buried in the sand and the other half is exposed. The straw decreases the wind velocity near the ground surface and can prevent wind erosion of the soil. In regions where the annual precipitation is over 200 mm, bushes and herbs can be planted to further improve the windbreak and sand dune fixation qualities. After establishment, the straw gradually rots to become organic soil matter.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China continues to show its commitment to curbing the potentially devastating and far-reaching effects of desertification through various projects that aim to not only rehabilitate degraded land, but empower communities and ensure the long-term economic growth of the territory.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/what-satellite-imagery-tells-us-about-vegetation-in-the-mu-us-desert\/"},"Page 41":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/oceans\">Oceans<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Decarbonising Freight Shipping the Next Port of Call?<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/suchetana-mukhopadhyay\/\">Suchetana Mukhopadhyay<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <\/span><span>Nov 5th 2019<\/span><span>3 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Decarbonising Freight Shipping the Next Port of Call?\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ship-56569_1280-1024x708.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Decarbonising Freight Shipping the Next Port of Call?\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ship-56569_1280-1024x708.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>With <a href=\"https:\/\/business.un.org\/en\/entities\/13\" target=\"_blank\">90% of trade <\/a>being carried out at sea, freight shipping is a crucial part of the global economy.

An entrepreneur and a global evangelist against single-use plastic, Leeson spends his time leading global awareness to counter the plastic menace by highlighting its impact on humans and other species. <\/b><b>As part of Earth.Org\u2019s \u2018Our Planet Series\u2019, Craig Leeson sat with Earth.Org for a fireside chat to discuss his documentary, his mission, and his hopes about the future.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><\/p><p><b>Earth.Org: Over 90% of the plastics in the world are not recycled. <\/b><b>Isn\u2019t it everybody\u2019s responsibility to do something about plastic? How successful were you in eliminating plastic from your daily life? Is it an easy thing to do?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leeson: It is a hard question, particularly for a person who made a film about the problem. It is extraordinarily difficult to remove single-use plastic from your life, particularly for our generation, because it has become our habit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, I was opening a conference in Switzerland, where members of corporates and governments were present. In order to grab their attention, I stood up and opened my speech saying \u2018I am here to tell you about my addiction. I am a recovering addict.\u2019 Everybody was looking at me and going \u2018what is he talking about.\u2019 Then I took them through.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of single-use plastic was brought to me by the producer of the film. Because I was not aware of it <em>until I was made aware of it<\/em>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I said in many of my talks, I am an ocean guy. I surf. I dive. I make films about the ocean.\u00a0 So if I did not know about the plastic problem in the ocean, how can I expect somebody from Mexico or Idaho or Singapore or someone who is completely removed from the oceans and lives in the mountains to understand the problem. I was oblivious about it myself.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I realised that plastic had become such a part of my life that it had become invisible to me. I just did not see it until it was pointed out to me, and I was told it was causing specific problems. And then when I started looking for it,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I saw it everywhere. I saw it between my toes when I was on the beach. I saw it in the seaweed. I saw it floating between my legs while I was surfing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you see it, when you start to look at the problems it causes; when you investigate the human health consequences, you cannot unsee it. And that\u2019s one of the important points we touched upon in the film for the very first time and something that I have been following up with a great deal of interest. I talk to governments about the human health consequences of plastic, and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that\u2019s when they start to listen. These are such powerful problems that they rise above the noise of lobbyists, who are concerned about other issues.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Human health is a big-budget issue for many finance ministers. So to answer your question, I did not know it (plastic) was a problem 10 years ago. And it was until someone pointed out to me that it became a problem. That\u2019s what I wanted to do with the film: to point it out to everybody else.<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/earth-org-mapping-the-future-with-paul-niel\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mapping the Future With Paul Niel<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><b>EO: The societal impact of plastic and pollution is the angle to which people are susceptible. When you speak to large audience from different cultures, whether they are policymakers or common people, would you rather connect with them by saying \u2018plastic is bad because it affects your health\u2019, or \u2018we should have more empathy towards the world in which we live in\u00a0 and consider other animals?\u2019 Which one of these arguments is more powerful?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leeson: I think it\u2019s both. I think we can all agree that the world needs a lot more empathy. Empathy is the key to understanding. In the film, I say with knowing comes caring, and with caring comes change. Because if you don\u2019t know, you can\u2019t care. So the first stage is to know. And once you know,\u00a0 you can choose to care, or not. Of course, we choose to care depending on how connected we feel to something.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we start to look at the human health consequences of single-use plastic, we realise that it actually affects the next generation; that means our kids. I do not have children, but I am awfully worried about the next generation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am also worried about other species because I am a naturalist. I grew up on the beach and I studied wildlife since I was little. I understand the animals we share space with are intelligent. They feel the pain and have other emotions as we do. Because we cannot physically communicate with them, we think they do not have the intelligence or the ability to show emotions. But I have seen it in the wild. I have seen it up close. I have experienced it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt personally responsible when we were filming shearwater chicks on Lord Howe Island \u2014 500 km east of Sydney. It\u2019s the very southern tip of the great barrier coral reefs. It\u2019s a beautiful island with a small population. There is no plastic production facility there. Yet, when you walk on the island, you see plastic pieces near the barrows, where the shearwaters bring up their babies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shearwaters travel several miles to catch fish from the ocean. When plastic remains in the ocean for 10 or 20 years, it develops algae. Sometimes fish lays eggs on the plastic pieces. With marine growth over them, the floating debris smell like marine organisms, which attract the shearwater. The birds dive down and swallow the plastic, fly back to their barrows, and feed them to their young chicks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the island, we found dozens of baby birds starved to death. When they eat plastic pieces,\u00a0 they feel full, but they don\u2019t get any nourishment from them. They just fall and die when they are about to take their first flight near the beach.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we were doing necropsies on these birds, we found a tiny bird\u2019s stomach bulging with plastic. There were 267 pieces of plastic inside! When I saw the first red bottle cap among them, I thought that cap could have been the one I had thrown away 10 years ago. And if that cap did not kill this bird, it might have been picked up by another bird. Because 90% of birds have swallowed plastic at some point in their life. It is highly likely that I was responsible for the death of marine animals or birds all over the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It hit me then. I could see the pain and suffering these animals were going through. And when you have such experience it has a profound effect on you. Then I knew we had to get the film out and make people see what we were seeing. The whole idea was to take people along with us through this journey as we were experiencing all of this.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_13041\" style=\"width: 770px\"><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-13041\" class=\"wp-image-13041\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08159-300x200.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08159-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08159-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08159-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" height=\"507\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20760%20507'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"760\"><noscript><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-13041\" class=\"wp-image-13041\" height=\"507\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08159-300x200.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08159-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08159-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08159-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" width=\"760\"\/><\/noscript><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-13041\">Craig Leeson (left) interviewed by Marco Pellerey, Co-Founder of Earth.Org<\/p><\/img><\/div><p><b>EO: A few years ago, I remember seeing pictures of the birds filled with plastic lying on the beach. I remember thinking \u2018that\u2019s not real, someone is doing this because they want to get their point across.\u2019 But when I saw it in your movie, I connected the dots.<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leeson: When we went to Midway Island in the North Pacific Ocean, we found not dozens but hundreds of albatross birds dead on the beach. These are big birds. And as their bodies decompose, through their ribs, you see the colors of plastic coming out. As you say, it looks surreal. It looks like a grotesque piece of art.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>EO: I was truly shocked by that. And it is depressing to watch. So let\u2019s talk about optimism. There are many reasons to be optimistic. 90% of the scientists who ever lived are alive today. Technology is exploding at an unprecedented rate. Do you believe technology is the solution?\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leeson: Before answering that, let me go back a bit. When we finished making this film after four years of production process visiting 22 different countries, and watched the four-hour-long first cut, there were 20 minutes of silence among the producers. Everybody was just looking at the screen. I realised that we could not release the film because it was so depressing. My producer then looked at me and said we had to reshoot the third act of the film.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We then raised money and reshoot for six months to make the third act all about solutions.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanted everybody to leave the cinema with the thought that they were personally responsible for the problem like I did. And they should start doing something themselves at home to solve the problem; whether it is stopping the use of straws or taking a bag to the supermarket and reusing it. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We included every possible solution in the movie. So, optimism was incredibly important in the film.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What made me optimistic after releasing the film were the kids I interacted with. We toured schools all around the world with a 20-minute long version of the film. I was also doing talks for bankers, governments, ministers and all sorts of smart people. With adults, I had to explain everything from the beginning. But, the kids already knew about the issue. All they wanted to know was \u2018how to solve the problem, where are the tools, who\u2019s going to help us get them, and when do we start\u2019. It made me so optimistic that I was able to go around the world and show the film feeling empowered.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thinking about the next generation is important for adults because that\u2019s what should drive us. That\u2019s what drove me when we went around screening.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going back to your question, is technology the answer, no. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s one of the answers. The danger of relying on technology thinking it is the answer is that we leave it up to the scientists and entrepreneurs to solve the problem while we keep on using single-use plastic. We cannot encourage people to do that.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banning single-use plastic is the number one answer and solution.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>EO: People are fascinated by entrepreneurs, who focus on space exploration, colonizing mars, etc. Space X is attracting a lot of attention. Do we need an \u2018Earth X\u2019? What do you think about the fact that people focus too much on starts and not on this planet?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leeson: That\u2019s a hard question because I am a bit of a space cadet. I am a dreamer. It is very difficult for me to believe that we are the only civilisation in the infinite expanse of the universe. I firmly believe in science, and we have to look at other places in the universe to understand our place here.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But colonising another planet that has no oxygen, no plant life, and no sustenance when we got a perfect island here seems ludicrous to me. We know more about the surface of the moon than we know about the oceans. More people have been to the moon than to the bottom of the ocean. That is crazy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we know from the recent expedition is that there is single-use plastic down in the Mariana Trench \u2014 more than 10,000 metres below the surface of the ocean.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those are the places where technology won\u2019t work because we do not have any technology that can clean up plastic anywhere in the oceans let alone the deepest trench on the planet Earth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we need to sort out the problems on earth before getting to any place that does not support life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>EO: Your documentary was an amazing success. It was even screened at the United Nations.\u00a0 How was your experience interacting with the audience at the UN?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leeson: We screened the 22-minute-version of the film for the 700 members at the UN General Assembly in New York. Even though I knew we had a great film, it was not until that moment I realised how powerful storytelling can be. How it can bring people together on the same page. The film had done that. And that\u2019s why David Attenborough called it \u2018the most important film of all time\u2019.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting up, we noticed that we were served water in plastic bottles. Before we started the discussion about the film, I told the audience \u2018I don\u2019t wish to embarrass my host, because that is not my intention. But I would like to talk about the invisibility of plastic.\u2019 I asked them if anyone could see the invisible plastic around them. Everybody was looking around. I had to literally pick up and show them the bottles. I heard the gasps across the auditorium. No one had paid much attention to the bottles until I pointed out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those bottles turned out to be a really good tool to talk about invisibility and problems of single-use plastic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p> <img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-13042\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08170-300x200.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08170-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08170-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08170-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" height=\"507\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20760%20507'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"760\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-13042\" height=\"507\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08170-300x200.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08170-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08170-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/DSC08170-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" width=\"760\"\/><\/noscript><p><b>EO: You are part of a music band. It\u2019s your passion. In your life, how do music and your profession intertwine?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leeson: My band is called Uranus. We have five members. The band was named by the lead singer way. Not by me. I know the joke never gets old (chuckles).\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music is such a wonderful thing that brings people together. Not just people, animals too. Every single species has music of their own; from the blue whale to the smallest of insects. That\u2019s what I love about music.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My father was a concert pianist. He was actually a journalist, who studied piano six hours every day.\u00a0 He tried to teach me piano, but it was too technical. It was boring for me.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was then thinking \u2018what musical instrument that would drive my parents nuts? The answer was the guitar. I did some odd jobs and bought an electric guitar with the money. I have been torturing my parents ever since (chuckles).\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our band has released an album called \u2018Plugged\u2019.

I enjoy music as a stress relief.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>EO: Moving from Uranus to glaciers, which is the subject of your next documentary, Iceland recently held a funeral for Okjokull glacier, which had melted away. The plaque at the ceremony reads <em>\u201cin the next 200 years all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.\u201d<\/em> Can you comment on that<\/b><b>?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leeson: My next film is called \u2018The Last Glaciers\u2019 \u2014 very much for this reason. I started this project similar way I started \u2018A Plastic Ocean\u2019. Four years ago, I was taken to the Alps, where I came across glaciers receding because of climate change.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in Hong Kong, while I was giving a talk about \u2018A Plastic Ocean\u2019, I met a scientist, who had been to travel around the world collecting samples from glaciers to study the atmospheric gases trapped in the ice. It was the first time anybody ever explained climate change to me in the simplest words. It set off so many light bulbs about the trip that I had just undertaken to The Alps. So I wanted to know more about it. I went to Grenoble in France and followed him and his team to learn what they were studying.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their studies showed how the greenhouse gases trapped in these glaciers were being released into the atmosphere. Their oscillation graphs showed how levels of methane and CO2 in the atmosphere have doubled in the last 120 years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I traveled around, I learned more. In Peru, half of the Qori Kalis glaciers are gone since 1990. In Antartica, they (the scientists) are recording the loss of ice the size of titanic every 10 seconds. The same thing is happening in the Arctic. The ice is breaking up exposing the deep blue ocean to the sunlight which increases the heat in the atmosphere causing a positive feedback loop.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a month, we will be climbing the Himalayas to see the glaciers there. The Himalayas,\u00a0 which is considered as the third pole, have so many glaciers that all the water in every major river system in Asia originate from there. What we now find is that these glaciers are melting three times faster than originally thought 40 years ago. If that ice melts, it is going to affect two billion people.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>EO: Can you tell us about the fundraising efforts you have initiated for this project?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leeson: It cost us 4.5 million to make \u2018A Plastic Ocean\u2019. We used two submarines to take us to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. We had the best cinematography crew on the planet with three big cinematic 4K cameras underwater. It took us two years to find the people who would understand the importance of the documentary and ready to fund the project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, we have been shooting \u2018The Last Glaciers\u2019 for the last three years. Because we have not been able to get external funding for the project, so far, I and my producer have been putting the money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most big corporations that have the ability to fund this project are in some ways contributing to climate change. If they are not fossil fuel companies, they are companies that use heavy transportation. We cannot go to car companies like Toyota or Mercedes, even if they are keen to get involved.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also did not want to get involved with companies that are going to use our product for greenwashing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So in the end, we decided, we will go as far as we can with our own money.

But personally, I believe that plastic manufacturers should be responsible for such tasks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my film, I showed how Germany successfully created the first closed-loop system of the circular economy because they used legislation to make the plastic manufacturers responsible. The plastic manufacturers were forced to pay for collecting the single-use plastic back. In Germany, every supermarket has reverse vending machines that reward consumers when they dispose of plastic.<\/span><\/p><p><b>EO: Does recycling work in Hong Kong?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leeson: No. Recycling does not work anywhere in the world. I have seen it personally. I have visited every possible recycling plant. Recycling never works because it was never designed to work. It was a marketing campaign started by plastic manufacturers to shift the blame from them to the consumers. Plastic is the most durable material. Every single plastic ever made is still in existence. How can we recycle it infinitely? You can recycle the products a couple of times if you have the infrastructure. But, the plastic industry never set up any infrastructure to recycle the plastic. They relied on governments to do that.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can observe the recycling bins on the streets when the garbage collectors come. They just take everything from the sorted bins and put them together and take them to the landfills. So recycling has not worked here.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>EO: What\u2019s your number one argument to convince people about the plastic problem?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leeson: Show them \u2018A Plastic Ocean.\u2019<\/span><\/p><p><b>EO: Different cultures have different ideas about reducing waste and reducing use. How do you change a culture?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leeson: Culture plays a really important role in this. In the film, we go to an island called Tuvalu Island which is 800 miles north of Fiji, in the Pacific. In 1978, a supermarket was opened and single-use plastic became normal here. Today, at the northern part of the island, there is a 10 feet high heap of plastic waste. They cannot bury the plastic under the dirt, because there is no dirt as it is a coral island. They cannot dig into the island. So, culture plays a big role, while education can be used to help them adjust to the new paradigm.<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/rethinking-the-environment-with-craig-leeson\/"},"Page 43":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/energy\">Energy<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/solutions\">Solutions<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage: A Silver Bullet for Carbon Emissions?<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/liam-mcgill\/\">Liam McGill<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <\/span><span>Sep 2nd 2019<\/span><span>3 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage: A Silver Bullet for Carbon Emissions?\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/petter-rudwall-GVLhWdib3BU-unsplash-1024x595.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage: A Silver Bullet for Carbon Emissions?\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/petter-rudwall-GVLhWdib3BU-unsplash-1024x595.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><b>As a carbon mitigation tool, Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is gaining momentum among scientists and conservationists.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) recorded 33.1 gigatons of carbon emissions in the global energy sector, up 1.7% from the previous year.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) produced during the process is captured and sequestered in geological storage units. In simplest terms, the BECCS procedure goes like this: plant thousands of trees which remove CO2 from the atmosphere, burn those trees instead of fossil fuels to produce energy, capture the emitted CO2, and then store it underground. It might sound counterintuitive to burn trees to cut emissions. But the ultimate result of the BECCS is the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/south-asia-could-be-facing-an-energy-crisis\/\" target=\"_blank\">South Asia Could Be Facing an Energy Crisis<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_12769\" style=\"width: 860px\"><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12769\" class=\"wp-image-12769 size-full\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Bioenergy-linked-with-carbon-dioxide-capture-and-storage-BECCS-Capturing-the-CO-2-1.png\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Bioenergy-linked-with-carbon-dioxide-capture-and-storage-BECCS-Capturing-the-CO-2-1.png 850w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Bioenergy-linked-with-carbon-dioxide-capture-and-storage-BECCS-Capturing-the-CO-2-1-300x204.png 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Bioenergy-linked-with-carbon-dioxide-capture-and-storage-BECCS-Capturing-the-CO-2-1-768x523.png 768w\" height=\"579\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20850%20579'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"850\"><noscript><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12769\" class=\"wp-image-12769 size-full\" height=\"579\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Bioenergy-linked-with-carbon-dioxide-capture-and-storage-BECCS-Capturing-the-CO-2-1.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Bioenergy-linked-with-carbon-dioxide-capture-and-storage-BECCS-Capturing-the-CO-2-1.png 850w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Bioenergy-linked-with-carbon-dioxide-capture-and-storage-BECCS-Capturing-the-CO-2-1-300x204.png 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Bioenergy-linked-with-carbon-dioxide-capture-and-storage-BECCS-Capturing-the-CO-2-1-768x523.png 768w\" width=\"850\"\/><\/noscript><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-12769\">BECCS process<\/p><\/img><\/div><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If executed efficiently, BECCS will have a significant impact on the energy sector\u2019s carbon footprint. For instance, if the US could sequester CO2 using BECCS, it could reduce emissions by one gigaton of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2eq) annually by 2050.

As an emerging technology, it raises a lot of questions and challenges that are still being debated. Industrial-scale implementation of this solution needs substantial resources: trees need land, water, and even fertilisers; the energy production process needs new transportation facilities and industrial infrastructure. While the usage of a large volume of water may put pressure on the existing irrigation system, a massive amount of fertilisers may cause serious environmental damage.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1748-9326\/aabf9f\/meta\" target=\"_blank\">A recent study<\/a> on BECCS states that it would cause food shortage in the future.\u00a0 The world will have to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fao.org\/fileadmin\/templates\/wsfs\/docs\/Issues_papers\/HLEF2050_Global_Agriculture.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">produce 70% extra food by 2050<\/a> to keep up with the increasing population, and that means designating more land for agriculture. For a global scale deployment of BECCS, the world needs between 300-600 million hectares of additional land\u2013an area the size of the European Union.

Only 3% of the water on the Earth\u2019s surface is freshwater. Less than 0.5% of that is accessible for consumption as drinking water. If no urgent action is taken, an increasing number of cities worldwide are expected to experience severe water shortages. Recent analyses by the BBC ranked cities such as Beijing, Tokyo and London among those <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-42982959\" target=\"_blank\">most likely to run out of drinking water<\/a> in the near future.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>How Does Climate Change Affect Water Availability?<\/strong><\/p><p>Climate change is expected to severely alter the quantity, quality and spatial distribution of global water resources. Warmer temperatures increase evaporation, change the holding capacity of moisture in the air and alter rainfall patterns. The most recent IPCC report concluded that, in general, wet regions will get wetter and dry regions will get drier. Increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme events like droughts and heatwaves will also contribute to water stress and water shortages.<\/p><p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41561-018-0265-7\" target=\"_blank\">ground-breaking study<\/a> on the impacts of climate change to groundwater resources was recently published in <em>Nature Climate Change.<\/em> The study showed that groundwater stored in aquifers, which provides 36% of the world\u2019s domestic water supply for over 2 billion people, is highly sensitive to future climate change.<\/p><p>Groundwater is stored in underground aquifers that are replenished by rainfall and soil moisture. Could this groundwater be depleted, potentially spurring the planet to run out of water? Researchers found that 44% of all aquifers globally will be fully impacted and depleted as a result of climate change in the next 100 years due to changes in the intensity and pattern of rainfalls. Underground water reserves in drier regions are naturally slow at adjusting to above-ground atmospheric and climactic changes, but over-abstraction and other impacts of extreme drought may still exacerbate regional water stress.<\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/does-china-have-a-pork-crisis\/\" target=\"_blank\">Does China Have a Pork Crisis?<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-694\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture1.png\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture1.png 924w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture1-300x154.png 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture1-768x394.png 768w\" height=\"474\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20924%20474'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"924\"><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-694\" height=\"474\" sizes=\"(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture1.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture1.png 924w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture1-300x154.png 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture1-768x394.png 768w\" width=\"924\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption><strong><em>Figure 1<\/em><\/strong><em> Groundwater response time: measure of the time in number of years it takes a groundwater system to re-equilibrate (replenish and discharge into rivers, lakes or streams) to changing conditions<\/em><\/figcaption><\/img><\/figure><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41561-018-0265-7\" target=\"_blank\">Another recent study<\/a> concluded that total water storage in landlocked river basins has declined significantly over the past few decades. Using gravity satellite observations from the NASA GRACE satellite, researchers calculated that water storage is declining by 100 billion tonnes per year, which is attributable to climate change and unsustainable water management. Given that most of the landlocked basins are in arid regions, there are significant implications to regional water stress.<\/p><p>A consequent impact of water storage decline is its contribution to sea level rise. Because of conservation of mass in the earth system, water lost in landlocked basins impacts global sea level through changes to the water vapour flux. Water loss in landlocked river basins accounted for about 10% of global sea level rise observed in the past 10 years.<\/p><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-695\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture2.png\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture2.png 924w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture2-300x153.png 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture2-768x392.png 768w\" height=\"472\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20924%20472'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" width=\"924\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-695\" height=\"472\" sizes=\"(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture2.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture2.png 924w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture2-300x153.png 300w, https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Picture2-768x392.png 768w\" width=\"924\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption><strong><em>Figure 2<\/em><\/strong><em> Total water storage change in mm per year in global landlocked river basins<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Why is the Water Cycle Important?<\/strong><\/p><p>There is a growing consensus around the idea that anthropogenic climate change is already significantly changing the global water cycle and that the sustainability of freshwater sources is being compromised.<\/p><p>Urbanisation and an exponential increase in freshwater demand for households are driving factors behind water shortages, especially in regions with a precarious water supply.

An IoT system refers to a network of physical objects that have been embedded with communications software, wireless environmental sensors, and automated control systems. An IoT system can monitor structural integrity and environmental factors, and can communicate with the rest of the system to perform real time risk analysis. IoT infrastructures have been highly successful in optimising the efficiency of wind and solar power farms by minimising risk and redundancy and maximising output. A water management IoT system can monitor air, water, and soil conditions autonomously and waste can be reduced via timely responses to weather events and water demand. Governments should invest in IoT research with a view towards significant long-term savings and increased efficiency in water management.<\/span><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/are-we-running-out-of-water\/"},"Page 48":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/policy-and-economics\">Policy &amp; Economics<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">WEF: CEOs Must be More Aggressive in Tackling Climate Change and Backing a Carbon Tax<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <\/span><span>Jan 28th 2019<\/span><span>3 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"WEF: CEOs Must be More Aggressive in Tackling Climate Change and Backing a Carbon Tax\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Image-REUTERS-Arnd-Wiegmann.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"WEF: CEOs Must be More Aggressive in Tackling Climate Change and Backing a Carbon Tax\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Image-REUTERS-Arnd-Wiegmann.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>The world is \u201closing the race\u201d on tackling climate change, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres candidly told business and political leaders at the first major international gathering of the year.

This is the first time this parasite has been detected in New York. The DEC believes this parasite is responsible for mass die-offs of adult scallops recorded in 2019 and 2020. While the parasite is not dangerous to humans, its recent toll on bay scallops has been devastating to this locally significant fishery.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>E<\/strong>very winter, baymen ply the waters around New York\u2019s Long Island to harvest the iconic Peconic bay scallops. The scallops are cousins of the clam and have a unique biology: they are functional hermaphrodites, releasing both eggs and sperm during a single spawning session. Adults also have the ability to \u201cswim\u201d by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peconicestuary.org\/peconic-bay-scallop\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clapping their two valves<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to expel streams of water that propel them away from predators. Harvesting is difficult, physically taxing work that supports livelihoods during otherwise slow fishing months, and the haul is eagerly awaited by seafood aficionados.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the catastrophic die-offs, bay scallops aggregated across Long Island had a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/press\/119444.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dockside value of $1.6<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> million and employed a multitude of fishermen, who have now been compelled to find other work in an economy already challenged by COVID-19. The financial plight of baymen, combined with the ripple effect of an economic downturn and a changing fishing environment on Long Island, is not new. Singer\/songwriter Billy Joel, himself a native Long Islander, immortalised the baymens\u2019 struggle with Long Island\u2019s changing marine health in his popular 1989 song, \u201cDowneaster Alexa.\u201d The reasons for declining marine animal populations have historically included overfishing, indiscriminate fishing techniques, and now, climate change and invasive species.<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/the-world-is-not-prepared-for-climate-change\/\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018The World is Not Prepared for Climate Change\u2019- UN Environment Chief<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to prevent the scallop die-off from becoming an annual event, the DEC is working with Stony Brook University\u2019s Marine Animal Disease Laboratory to \u201cinvestigate environmental factors that promote disease development of the parasite and monitor its geographical extent,\u201d according to Commissioner Basil Seggos in a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/press\/119444.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Bay scallops are known to be sensitive to high water temperature; the theory is that rising water temperatures have made adult scallops especially physiologically susceptible to the parasite, contributing to the high mortality rate. According to Dr. Tettlebach, 2019 set a record for the warmest water temperatures in the last five years, topping <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/suffolktimes.timesreview.com\/2020\/02\/parasite-linked-to-scallops-die-off-in-peconic-bay-dec-says\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">29 degrees Celsius<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concerned that the last two years are the beginning of a pattern, in December 2019, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo sent a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.governor.ny.gov\/news\/governor-cuomo-issues-letter-us-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-requesting-federal-fishery\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">letter<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the United States Secretary of Commerce requesting a federal disaster declaration for the bay scallops.

In addition, as part of his 2020 State of the State report, Governor Cuomo proposed the Restore Mother Nature initiative, touted as the nation\u2019s most aggressive program for restoring habitats and controlling floods. This initiative would double funding of New York\u2019s existing artificial reef programme and other shellfish restoration initiatives. Funding would come from the Governor\u2019s $3 billion environmental bond act proposal and a separate $300 million earmarked to the state Environmental Protection Fund.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Importantly, juvenile scallops do not appear to be part of the die-off, so optimism remains that sufficient numbers will survive to reproduce in 2021. This news is promising. Expanding our understanding of how this parasite proliferates, appropriating public funds to protect the scallops, and recognising the impact of changing environmental factors on these vulnerable creatures, will be key to protecting this locally vital marine resource.<\/span><\/p><p><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/66461827@N08\/6201597953\/in\/photolist-as1P1D-9RdVX1-7QkXc5-f2kFv-DKfkb-9nmKDW-9iFYVS-bQAQMk-87pr4f-pvWwAz-8qirt5-mgZsup-9KGAdZ-a28NS7-3mxNV7-aDjnPQ-bwuRYq-J1ABu-bQxo18-dq8Y5Y-inMkb7-eB624N-iiDgiM-cSVzx-inPfsY-53N1QC-iiDe4Z-9iCRNM-f2kFw-6aHcu6-6aMnBs-23ut1P6-2gXGozX-eHrErW-eaMGqz-ouKe9G-UcMbN1-7rJFTF-2iGUvjq-cefg3j-5QPFAV-eB5kMm-a5NT42-5Uv4kM-99ASxa-7FuP5f-8pyTFH-2iy7GPQ-78xCTY-FQJCd\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr\u00a0<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/new-york-scallops-parasite\/"},"Page 2":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Cultivating Healthier Environments May Be Crucial in Addressing Antibiotic Resistance<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/haley-toadvine\/\">Haley Toadvine<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Jan 11th 2021<\/span><span>5 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Cultivating Healthier Environments May Be Crucial in Addressing Antibiotic Resistance\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/rsz_volodymyr-hryshchenko-e8yfkjn2czy-unsplash.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Cultivating Healthier Environments May Be Crucial in Addressing Antibiotic Resistance\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/rsz_volodymyr-hryshchenko-e8yfkjn2czy-unsplash.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/antimicrobial-resistance\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Antimicrobial resistance<\/b><\/a><b> (AMR), the development in which \u201cbacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines\u201d has been declared one of the <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/spotlight\/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019\" target=\"_blank\"><b>World Health Organization\u2019s<\/b><\/a><b> Top 10 Global Health Threats Facing Humanity.\u00a0 Antimicrobial resistance causes an increased risk of disease spread, severe illness and death.

Meningitis, pneumonia and tuberculosis were death sentences; the average global life expectancy was 47 years old. As of 2016, it was 72 years old.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the discovery of antibiotics came not only a treatment for otherwise deadly ailments, but also the opportunity for advancements in life-saving and life-enhancing medical interventions.

Antibiotics have gifted us the peace of mind to engage in activities such as participating in sports and enjoying the outdoors knowing that there are drugs to treat any possible subsequent infections. Most incredibly, antibiotics have increased life expectancy to nearly 78 years old in developed nations.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, antibiotic resistance is on the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/antimicrobial-resistance\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rise<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, threatening our comfortable reliance on the drugs. Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria adapt and no longer respond to the very medications designed to kill or stunt them.

As a result, warmer climates may be leading to faster growth and faster spread of resistant genes amongst bacteria; \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Southern European countries with minimum temperatures that were 10\u00b0C warmer due to climate change- like Spain, Portugal, Romania and Italy- recorded a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change-linked-to-antibiotic-resistance\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more rapid rise in antibiotic resistance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over time than cooler northern European countries like Sweden, Finland and Norway.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health Organization (WHO) collectively released a statement in which they called for all sectors of society to rally behind a \u201cbold, unified agenda;\u201d \u201cto stay ahead of antimicrobial resistance, countries must put in place policies that encourage agricultural best practices that prioritise preventing infections.\u201d It added that \u201chuman, environmental and animal health are inextricably linked.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The animal agriculture sector has the power to make a significant impact on the trajectory of antibiotic resistance by restricting the use of antibiotics for growth and improving factory farm conditions, thus eliminating the need to use antibiotics prophylactically. Individuals can make an impact by reducing meat consumption and advocating for change to policymakers. While animal agriculture is one sector of many that may lead to resistance, current farming practices are drastically contributing to an imminent public health disaster and must be addressed immediately.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/antibiotic-resistance\/"},"Page 3":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">6 Ways That 2021 Will Be an Important Year in the Fight Against Climate Change<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Jan 5th 2021<\/span><span>5 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"6 Ways That 2021 Will Be an Important Year in the Fight Against Climate Change\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/rsz_smoke-3178047_1280.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"6 Ways That 2021 Will Be an Important Year in the Fight Against Climate Change\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/rsz_smoke-3178047_1280.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>While COVID-19 was the biggest issue of 2020, we at Earth.Org are hoping that as the virus becomes somewhat manageable, the attention will be turned to climate change in 2021.

To restart economies, governments have produced stimulus packages, and some have used them as a way to incorporate green spending into recovery plans.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EU and US President-elect Joe Biden have promised trillions of dollars of green investments to reboot their economies while achieving decarbonisation as well. It is hoped that other countries will join them- and many have pledged to, as detailed later- which will help to reduce the cost of renewable energy globally. Already, a new report by the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/iea.org\/reports\/renewables-2020\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International Energy Agency (IEA)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has found that global renewable energy electricity installation will hit record levels in 2020 compared to the sharp declines in the fossil fuel sectors caused by COVID-19. Almost 90% of new electricity generation in 2020 will be from renewable energy sources. The EU and Biden also say that they intend to stick a tax on imports of countries that emit too much carbon in an attempt to encourage them to clean up their acts.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is hoped that the world will use COVID-19 to forge a greener path, but countries need to cooperate to ensure that this task is taken on by all.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><ul><li><strong>Carbon Emissions Have Dropped, But Where To From Here?<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the annual <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalcarbonproject.org\/carbonbudget\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global Carbon Budget<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> report says that global emissions dropped 7% in 2020, it will make no difference to long-term climate change. Further, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-55498657\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to the UN<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, despite the growth of renewable energy, developed nations are spending 50% more on sectors linked to fossil fuels than on low-carbon energy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This drop is temporary because it was due to behavioural changes, not structural. However, these behavioural changes can become structural; for example, if more people continue to work from home and if cities are made more cyclist and walker- friendly. Other changes, like switching to renewable energy and an increase in electric vehicles, should also be pursued urgently.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the IPCC, emissions need to be halved by 2030 if we are to meet the 1.5C goal as outlined in the Paris Agreement.

In September in a surprise announcement, China pledged to reach peak emissions by 2030, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

President-elect Joe Biden in the US has made climate change one of the central tenets of his campaign, so it is hoped that in 2021, he can make some headway in bringing down the emissions of the biggest economy in the world.<\/span><\/p><ul><li><strong>Important Climate Conferences<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After being postponed last year, the COP26 conference will now take place in Glasgow in November this year, where world leaders will discuss their climate plans. The conference is seen as the successor to the landmark Paris meeting of 2015, which was the first time nearly all nations of the world came together to agree that climate change action needed to be taken by all. However, the world has fallen far short of the targets set by the agreement, which was to keep global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100, but ideally to keep it below 1.5C.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following current trajectories, the world is expected to breach this 1.5C threshold within 12 years or less and to hit 3C of warming by 2100.

Added to this is that the cost of renewable energy is falling and there is mounting public pressure for action on climate, all of which is changing the attitudes in business. Why invest in new oil wells or coal power stations that will become obsolete before they can repay themselves over their 20 to 30-year life?<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These \u201cstranded assets\u201d are causing sustainability to come to the fore in the business world- Tesla\u2019s share price has skyrocketed, while Exxon\u2019s has plummeted. Meanwhile, more investment firms are making it clear that they will no longer invest in dirty fuels and that the companies they do invest in must embed climate risk into their financial decision making.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2021, it is imperative that countries with big climate commitments follow them up with strategies to achieve them to fight against climate change. This is the hope at Glasgow; that countries will sign up to policies that will start reducing emissions now.

Of the remaining high-integrity forests, only 27% are currently in nationally designated protected areas.<\/p><p>Identifying where intact forests remain allows for better planning and management. For instance, the tool has shown large swaths of high-integrity forests remaining in the Central African basin. This information, according to Emma Stokes, WCS regional director for Central Africa, will be used for fine-resolution detailed planning exercises aimed at protecting forests and livelihoods.<\/p><p>\u201cThese forests provide livelihoods [for] millions of people, and [are] the cultural and ancestral heart of many indigenous first peoples who live in that area, people who depended on them for tens of thousands of years,\u201d Stokes said.<\/p><p>The map allows users to see the difference in forest integrity across national borders and across regions. In eastern North America, for example, there is a clear gradient from high-integrity forests in Canada to lower-integrity, more degraded forests covering the southeastern United States.<\/p><p>\u201cIts because our market system is broken,\u201d Jamison Ervin, manager of Nature for Development, UNDP, said in a press briefing. \u201cWe don\u2019t value forests properly. We value forest by \u2026 board feet rather than the value that it provides for our life support systems.\u201d<\/p><p>Conserving forests is a critical part of achieving the international Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The current daft of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework proposes using ecosystem integrity targets, but, according to Hedley Grantham, WCS director of conservation planning and lead author of the study, discussions on how these targets will be measured are ongoing.<\/p><p>Broad conservation targets aimed at protecting a certain percentage of the world\u2019s forests, such as the 30% by 2030\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"internal\" href=\"https:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2020\/09\/world-leaders-pledge-to-protect-30-of-the-planet-by-2030\/\" target=\"_blank\">pledges<\/a>, are not really enough, said Tom Evans, WCS forest and climate change lead. If the protected forests are of low quality, they are of less value, and more intact ecosystems are more resilient to climate change.<\/p><p>\u201cForests are the key to maintaining local, national and global water security \u2026 they are key to sustaining more than a million forest-based livelihoods, especially for indigenous peoples, they harbor the world\u2019s last in the best places to protect biodiversity, and they\u2019re profoundly important for climate change,\u201d Ervin said. \u201cSimply put, without forests, we cannot achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement \u2026 Intact forests are one of our cheapest, most effective nature-based solutions for carbon drawdown with multiple benefits.\u201d<\/p><p>A limitation of the data is that they\u2019re based on a\u00a0standard\u00a0forest cover map that includes all woody vegetation, including both self-seeded (natural) as well as planted forests. Planted forests\u00a0do\u00a0generally show low integrity scores on the index, Evans notes, but because they are not isolated as a separate category, users\u00a0would\u00a0need to find other data sets\u00a0if they wanted to\u00a0systematically\u00a0distinguish among forest types. Another limitation is that some forms of forest degradation, such as the introduction of a non-native species,\u00a0may not register in the index in some circumstances.\u00a0However, Evans told Mongabay, \u201cmost over-exploitation would register, because it is highly correlated with ease of access and levels of nearby human pressure,\u00a0which the metric is built around.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201c[W]e encourage people to improve on this at that local level if the data is available,\u201d Grantham said. \u201cBut what it also says is that we\u2019ve probably underestimated the loss of forest integrity \u2026 our results are probably underestimating this [loss] globally.\u201d<\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>This article was <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2020\/12\/only-40-of-worlds-forests-have-high-ecological-integrity-a-new-index-reveals\/\" target=\"_blank\">originally published on Mongabay<\/a>, written by Liz Kimbrough, and is republished here as part of an editorial partnership with Earth.Org.<\/em><\/em><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/only-40-of-worlds-forests-have-high-ecological-integrity\/"},"Page 5":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/policy-and-economics\">Policy &amp; Economics<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Paris Agreement: 54 Cities on Track to Meet Targets<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <\/span><span>Dec 11th 2020<\/span><span>2 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Paris Agreement: 54 Cities on Track to Meet Targets\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/5862685992_ec62a2c626_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Paris Agreement: 54 Cities on Track to Meet Targets\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/5862685992_ec62a2c626_c.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>A new report has found that 54 cities around the world are on track to meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.c40.org\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>T<\/strong>he C40 Cities Network<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a coalition of the world\u2019s megacities working together towards the Paris Agreement and to address climate change, detailed mass tree-planting in Buenos Aires and new public transport networks in Mexico City, among others:<\/span><\/p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Houston, Texas, wants to build 800 km of new cycle lanes and establish 50 green energy companies by 2025, as well as plant 4.6 million trees in the next decade.

As lakes are particularly sensitive to variations in weather conditions, the amount of ice cover seen each winter can serve as a useful indicator of climatic changes.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Years in which lakes do not have total ice cover for at least one day are known as ice-free years. These are considered extreme climatic events, as the loss of lake ice can alter the conditions of freshwater ecosystems irreversibly. Moreover, such years have become more frequent and more severe in recent decades. Since the 1970s, over 15 000 lakes in the Northern Hemisphere have seen ice-free years, and it is becoming increasingly common for lake ice to break up earlier, freeze later and last for a shorter duration.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this year, researchers at York University in Canada carried out a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/news.agu.org\/press-release\/warmer-winters-are-keeping-some-lakes-from-freezing\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to investigate the relationship between global levels of greenhouse gases and the frequency of ice-free years. They began by acquiring lake ice cover records from the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado for 122 lakes across North America, Europe and Asia between 1939 and 2016. The sample included Lakes Suwa (Japan), Baikal (Russia), Geneva (Switzerland), Balaton (Hungary), Champlain (USA) and Michigan (USA).<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These records showed a sharp rise in the frequency of ice-free years since 1939. In the years between 1939 and 1978, 31 ice-free years were recorded and nearly 1% of the lakes had at least one ice-free winter, while a maximum of four lakes did not fully freeze in a given year. By contrast, in the years between 1978 and 2016, the number of ice-free years more than trebled to 108, and the average number of ice-free lakes in a year increased fivefold, with as many as 10 lakes not fully freezing in a single season.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The researchers then compared these figures with historical data for local winter air temperature, cloud cover and total precipitation. Rising winter temperatures, correlated with increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, were found to be the most important predictor of ice-free years.<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/glaciers-in-china-melting-at-shocking-pace\/\" target=\"_blank\">Glaciers in China Melting at \u2018Shocking\u2019 Pace, Scientists Say<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, the lakes saw ice-free years when mean winter temperatures rose above -6<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C (with the exception of Lake Balaton, which continued to freeze until temperatures exceeded 3<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C). While the probability of having an ice-free winter had risen dramatically for all lakes, those in more southern and coastal regions were especially vulnerable due to higher average winter temperatures.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drawing on these results, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/news.agu.org\/press-release\/warmer-winters-are-keeping-some-lakes-from-freezing\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alessandro Filazzola<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the lead author of the study, predicts that all 122 lakes will have more ice-free years in the future, regardless of whether greenhouse gas levels are kept in check. \u201cLake ice is becoming increasingly absent,\u201d he said. \u201cEven under low carbon emissions scenarios, we\u2019re going to have continued ice-free events.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If carbon emissions are curbed in the near future, the percentage of ice-free lakes is expected to continue increasing until around the year 2050, where it will plateau. However, if emissions rise, the rate of lake ice loss will increase until 2100 at least. For lakes with socioeconomic or ecological significance, higher carbon emissions would mean warmer winters, the loss of winter transport and recreational activities, and a greater risk of toxic algal blooms, which are harmful to marine life. It could also lead to the disappearance of winter traditions at culturally important lakes, such as Lake Suwa in Japan, where generations of Shinto priests have recorded and celebrated the formation of ice since 1443.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results of this study demonstrate a clear causal relationship between climate change and lake ice loss. Limiting carbon emissions would be the most effective way to reduce the frequency of ice-free years in the future, and to minimise their cultural, economic and biological implications. Records of ice-free years and winter temperatures can help to predict further ice loss and assess the severity of climate change, and should therefore be continually maintained. Moreover, while it is important to continue monitoring the 122 lakes from this study, this range should be broadened to include many more across the Northern Hemisphere. Further research into the impact of ice loss on ecological communities within freshwater ecosystems is also required.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/robromard\/25639441574\/in\/photolist-F4EQHu-jcTY3K-QsUnCq-2dRwavG-RZATfa-2iaUbjk-Sumhqd-2iAK4Lk-2imS8xs-2hKsbZV-2ifu2gd-2ew8oRG-2hFeFou-RRazFE-KBxSbY-24PNwvi-qzk3hp-S4Wowi-RaZEwK-YvxmtA-r6Ug3X-292nFn6-VnU8fs-jxwVUE-PRAoxS-RHwJiG-23MTxUz-NoPLPt-GvqmpQ-SsTwsR-HmdXVY-RHVexJ-TBzGPw-P8taKT-2i4mRBD-2hRDmXH-2ijnLEJ-2ixMb5r-RHgAQC-2hHeTFZ-RNCQB7-2iCYN24-4wKQcM-r4ArWu-24F8cTq-2f6PEVh-2hG6jhh-23Nh76a-2jVTN4Z-2iDbVmJ\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr\u00a0<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/northern-hemisphere-lakes-ice-free\/"},"Page 9":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Global Emissions Likely Peaked in 2019- Report<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/asia\">Asia<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/europe\">Europe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/oceania\">Oceania<\/a> <\/span><span>Nov 2nd 2020<\/span><span>2 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Global Emissions Likely Peaked in 2019- Report\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/rsz_cape-ortegal-117601_1280.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Global Emissions Likely Peaked in 2019- Report\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/rsz_cape-ortegal-117601_1280.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>According to a report from <a href=\"https:\/\/about.bnef.com\/new-energy-outlook\/\" target=\"_blank\">BloombergNEF (BNEF)<\/a>, global greenhouse gas emissions likely hit their peak in 2019.

We must find solutions for water and food scarcity as well as migration before it\u2019s too late.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/oxfam\/4053284810\/in\/photolist-7bb9mS-7baGLh-7b7k5c-p6egVV-7b6Ubc-7b7kpM-7b6U8X-7bb8pG-7b6U3H-7baGFo-7bb9rN-7b6HW2-7b7jQZ-7bawXJ-7baGPj-fCVznq-7bb87W-7b7kdn-7b7jWD-7bb94W-7b7jyB-7bawWd-p4j1N2-7b6SGi-WfcVG3-2hVNNTW-fPRFqG-Vf41cu-pHn6zt-yeaTZn-2hVRq2a-zbT7Ra-BaGwqh-yeaM2p-fPyX3K-yTBV8F-7b6SJt-7b6SKP-7b6SEV-7b6SNp-2guPjXk-dyE6KB-2cpffYk-2hWdsJd-2hW9SG2-9bLirj-2hWds8y-V2Mvu4-W7yi8t-z8JNDY\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr\u00a0<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-crisis-global-conflict\/"},"Page 13":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/biodiversity\">Biodiversity<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/conservation\">Conservation<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Brazilian Court Blocks Government\u2019s Decision to Revoke Mangrove Protections<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <\/span><span>Oct 1st 2020<\/span><span>2 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Brazilian Court Blocks Government\u2019s Decision to Revoke Mangrove Protections\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/rsz_brazil-51128_1280.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Brazilian Court Blocks Government\u2019s Decision to Revoke Mangrove Protections\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/rsz_brazil-51128_1280.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p class=\"p3\"><b>A court in Brazil has blocked a move by the government to revoke important regulations protecting the country\u2019s vital tropical mangroves. The decision comes just a day after Brazil\u2019s National Environment Council, known as Conama, voted to overturn the protection measures that defined the mangroves as \u201cpermanent preservation areas\u201d and prohibited commercial development projects. <\/b><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><b>\u2014<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>F<\/strong>ederal judge Maria Amelia Almeida Senos de Carvalho overturned the decision on September 29, saying the repeal violated the constitutional right to an ecologically balanced environment.

Those who live in countries where people express more concern about the climate crisis also tend to feel more personally impacted by it; people in Mexico and Turkey are the most worried and also feel the strongest personal impact. In contrast, those in countries including Sweden, Australia, Germany and the US say that they have experienced significantly less personal impact of the climate crisis and tend to express much lower levels of concern.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the UK, for example, just 13% of respondents said that they were personally affected by rising temperatures, compared to 34% who felt personally affected by COVID-19.

It happened on the same day as the Great Chicago Fire, which overshadowed the Wisconsin fire.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>The 1884 Great Hinckley Fire<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In September 1884, the Great Hinckley Fire broke out near the town of Hinckley, Minnesota. At that time, trees were commonly stripped of their branches before cutting them down for lumber, but that left pine forests filled with dry, dead branches. This fuelled the fire and caused it to burn 250 000 acres in just four hours. Officially, 418 people were killed but historians believe that hundreds of Native Americans were killed and were left out of the fatality count.<\/span><\/p><p><b>The 1881 Thumb Fire, Michigan<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thumb fire started on September 5 1881 in the Thumb region of eastern Michigan. The fire is thought to have been exacerbated by dry summer conditions and drought. Burning around 1 million acres, it spread from Lapeer County to Huron, Tuscola, Sanilac and Lapeer counties. At least 282 people were killed. The flames produced so much soot and ash that the sun was partially obscured in the East Coast, turning the sky a yellowish colour.<\/span><\/p><p>These are just some of the worst wildfires in US history; there are many more that have caused extensive damage to communities and landscapes.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/worst-wildfires-in-us-history\/"},"Page 16":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Massive Crater Discovered in Siberia: Did the Climate Crisis Cause It?<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>Sep 8th 2020<\/span><span>4 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Massive Crater Discovered in Siberia: Did the Climate Crisis Cause It?\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/800px-Patomsky_crater.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Massive Crater Discovered in Siberia: Did the Climate Crisis Cause It?\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/800px-Patomsky_crater.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>A crater at least 50 meters deep and 20 meters wide has been spotted in the tundra region in Siberia.

Recent hot summers in the region, including in 2020, may have contributed to the creation of these craters.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Methane- and other gases- can accumulate in the upper layers of this permafrost, which can create pressure that is strong enough to burst through the upper layers of frozen ground, scattering earth and rocks and creating craters, in a process called \u201ccryovolcanism.\u201d These craters turn into lakes within two years of being formed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers studied the newest crater and older ones, and found that mounds in the Earth formed just before the explosions. The craters were also all located on gentle slopes and had a lower portion that was cylindrical before opening into a funnel, with the opening around 20 to 25 meters wide.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They believe that extremely hot summers in the region in 2012 and 2016, and again in 2020, may have contributed to the growth and blowout of these mounds, which appear and explode within as little as three to five years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Methane accumulates in a process called \u201ccryopeg\u201d- a layer of unfrozen ground that never freezes because of its salt content below a table of ground ice- and acts as a trap. The gas escapes, forming a mound. When warm summers occur, the mound blows, creating the craters. Scientists say that as temperatures rise around the world and the climate continues to warm, melting permafrost is becoming more common and is therefore leading to more crater formations.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None of these features have been discovered or reported in the Alaskan or Canadian arctic. Researchers believe that the crater formations are unique to the Arctic region in Siberia because few other areas share the features believed to be necessary for them to form- a combination of table-like ground ice close to the surface, continuous permafrost with methane and unfrozen ground with saline deposits below the ice.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>How Are They Linked to the Climate Crisis?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Siberia experienced a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/siberia-experiences-heatwave-with-temperatures-10%E2%84%83-above-average\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prolonged heatwave<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, with unusually high temperatures linked to wildfires and a huge oil spill. Climate scientists called it \u201calarming\u201d and believed that it would push the planet towards its hottest year on record. Towns in the area recorded extraordinarily high temperatures, with Nizhnyaya Pesha hitting 30\u2103 on June 9 and Khatanga, which usually has temperatures of around 0\u2103 that time of year, hitting 25\u2103 on May 22. The highest temperature recorded previously was 12\u2103. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If linked to the climate crisis, these conditions would have certainly contributed to the blowout of the mounds.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some experts, however, aren\u2019t convinced that the progressing climate crisis is causing these craters. Anecdotal evidence suggests that explosions creating craters in the tundra have been happening for generations.

This slow and steady lifestyle strategy has served them well for millions of years, but now, in the face of modern pressures, it can be a big liability.<\/p><p>Young turtles are highly vulnerable to many different predators, and only a small percentage survive into adulthood. Turtles that do survive may live a long time (some up to 200 years). Most females lay eggs well into their final years. This lifetime of egg-laying ensures that enough hatchlings will survive to keep the population afloat.<\/p><p>Removing an adult female turtle from the wild also removes the hundreds to thousands of eggs it might have laid during its lifetime. If enough of them disappear, the population collapses. And once depleted, turtles and tortoise populations are very slow to recover, if they recover at all.<\/p><p>In May 2020, Mexican authorities\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/47a38d384256fb01a318b8d75645e803#:~:text=MEXICO%20CITY%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20Mexican,the%20outskirts%20of%20Mexico%20City.\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">confiscated<\/a>\u00a0more than 15,000 freshwater turtles illegally bound for the pet trade in China.

Rare species are seen as status symbols and collectors\u2019 items and are sold for hundreds to thousands of dollars.

Turtle farms supply a vast number of animals to markets, but many are still captured in the wild.<\/p><p>Turtle farming for food and medicinal markets is an enormous industry. In Southeast Asia, hundreds of millions of Chinese softshell turtles (<em>Pelodiscus sinensis<\/em>) are bred for the table. Asian box turtles, such as the Chinese three-striped box turtle (<em>Cuora trifasciata<\/em>), are both captive bred and collected from the wild for their supposed medicinal value. More than 1,500 turtle farms exist in southern China alone.<\/p><p>In some cases, turtle farms are used to disguise illegal activities. A farm may supplement its stock with wild-caught populations and lie about the origins to circumvent laws. Farms also engage in \u201cturtle laundering.\u201d For instance, if a tortoise is smuggled from Madagascar to China, it is no longer protected by native species laws in Madagascar and can be sold legally out of a Chinese turtle farm claiming it is captive-bred.<\/p><p>\u201cWhile some species are farmed sustainably, the problem is that turtle farms don\u2019t always limit themselves to those turtles. They also continue to take turtles from the wild and then call them captive-bred, but they\u2019re really not,\u201d said Craig Stanford, first author of the paper, professor at the University of Southern California and the chair of the IUCN Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group.<\/p><p>Loss of habitat is the biggest threat to turtles and tortoises globally, according to the paper. The leading cause of terrestrial habitat loss is the conversion of land for commercial agriculture. Logging and livestock grazing in wildlands also contribute to declines, as does habitat fragmentation from the expansion of towns, cities and roads.<\/p><p>Aquatic turtles face threats from river diversions, loss of wetlands, and landscape fragmentation. Dredging underwater logs and snags for recreational boating also eliminates habitat for freshwater turtles. They are particularly vulnerable to changes in water quality from dam construction, siltation, sand mining, sewage runoff, and pollution from industry and agriculture.<\/p><p>Turtles\u2019 long lives make them vulnerable to the pollution accumulated in the environment over time. For females that spend their lives on lake and river bottoms, exposure to toxins that accumulate in sediments, such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and heavy metals, can reduce the survivability of their offspring.<\/p><p>Commercial fisheries often accidentally catch aquatic turtles. Better fishery management practices such as the use of turtle exclusion devices have been successful, but are still not used everywhere. One\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0308597X17303020\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study<\/a>\u00a0estimated that, along the East Coast of the U.S., crab traps kill 15% to 78% of local diamondback terrapin (<em>Malaclemys terrapin<\/em>) populations each year.<\/p><p>Invasive plants and animals bring disease, parasites and competition to turtles.\u00a0 Bacteria and viruses such as\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378113514005549\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">herpes<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"http:\/\/refhub.elsevier.com\/S0960-9822(20)30636-9\/sref127\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ranaviruses<\/a>\u00a0are on the rise and causing die-offs in turtle populations. The introduced, invasive European red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes<\/em>) has devastated Australia\u2019s native turtle populations. Human development increases the population of predators such as pied crows (<em>Corvus albus<\/em>) and common ravens (<em>Corvus corax<\/em>), the latter of which prey heavily on Mojave Desert tortoises (<em>Gopherus agassizii<\/em>) in the southwestern United States.<\/p><p>Scientists are still uncovering the effects of climate change on turtles and tortoises since their long lives make changes over populations harder to study. Still, the paper\u2019s authors say droughts, changes in water cycles, habitat degradation, and rising sea temperatures are all taking a toll on turtle populations around the world.<\/p><p><strong>What Can Be Done?<\/strong><\/p><p>Preventing turtle extinctions this century requires protecting their remaining habitat, the authors write, particularly limited nesting habitats. They found the majority of turtles and tortoises on Earth could be protected by safeguarding 16 hotspots that cover 16% of the Earth\u2019s land surface.<\/p><p>\u201cWhy are they declining? Why are they in trouble? The problem is the failure of the regulatory agencies to take action,\u201d Berry told Mongabay. \u201cI think that if a country, such as the USA, can put a man on the moon then they\u2019re perfectly capable of recovering these endangered and threatened species.\u201d<\/p><p>Ending the trade of wild turtles for food, medicine and pets is also an important part of a global conservation strategy.\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/cites.org\/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CITES<\/a>\u00a0regulates trade by restricting international transport of the threatened turtle and tortoise species listed in its appendices. But legal loopholes remain. The researchers urge the enforcement of existing laws, the enactment of new laws closing loopholes, and increased public awareness.<\/p><p>Fortunately for turtle and tortoise species, many can breed in captivity, hopefully bringing them back from the brink of extinction. Captive breeding programs have brought species such as the Hood Island tortoise (<em>Chelonoidis hoodensis<\/em>), one of the dozen species of famed Gal\u00e1pagos giant tortoises, back from the brink of extinction. But for some species, such as the ploughshare tortoise, putting them back in the wild is futile until conditions become safe for release. Until then, the genetics of captive populations have to be managed to prevent issues like inbreeding depression.<\/p><p>\u201cEven if we breed them in captivity, we can\u2019t put them back in the wild because they\u2019ll just be poached for pet trade again because they\u2019re so valuable,\u201d Stanford said. \u201cSo even turtle farming is exacerbating this problem. How do you stop illegal trade when the value of an individual animal is many, many lifetime incomes for the people who are stealing them?\u201d<\/p><p>Sea turtles are a conservation success story. Nesting is\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"internal\" href=\"https:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2020\/05\/slow-and-steady-sea-turtles-mount-a-long-term-recovery\/\" target=\"_blank\">on the rise<\/a>\u00a0for most of these favorite marine species around the globe. Experts attribute this to better fishery practices, enforcement of laws aimed at curbing hunting and trade of sea turtles and their eggs, and dedicated conservation efforts<em>.\u00a0<\/em>These charismatic creatures receive much attention and funding in the turtle conservation world.<\/p><p>To increase their odds of survival, headstarting programs collect turtle eggs from beaches, put them in hatcheries, and keep hatchlings in captivity until they reach a certain size and aren\u2019t as appetizing for other marine creatures. These programs have had some success, reviving populations of turtles such as the Kemp\u2019s ridley sea turtle (<em>Lepidochelys kempii<\/em>) and the diamondback terrapin.<\/p><p>Conservation programs like headstarting have seen greater success when local people are engaged as stakeholders and informed about the issues, according to\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41893-018-0170-5\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">previous studies<\/a>.

To improve its water usage, Unilever has pledged to halve the water associated with the consumer use of its products by 2020 and maintain the water abstraction levels for production at or below 2008 levels by 2020. In 2019, they exceeded their second goal, where the water abstraction levels are 47% lower compared to 2008.

The explicit goals for the products department to halve product emissions, water consumption and waste are more difficult to achieve. However, the product department fails to even maintain the level of emissions and water impact at 2010 levels.

The strategy contains four main strategic objectives revolving around conserving and providing clean water sources to countries with high water risk.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first objective is to promote sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, and to adopt key hygiene behaviours. The US aims to increase the amount of sources for safe drinking water and sanitation, while decreasing the mortality rate related to unsafe drinking water and unhygienic living standards.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second objective is to encourage the sound management and protection of freshwater resources. This strategy primarily addresses physical water risk, in particular, flooding and groundwater deficiency. The US aims to support access to water supplies and protect ecosystems that provide these water supplies. It also focuses on improving preparedness for water-related disasters such as floods and megadroughts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third objective is to reduce conflict by promoting cooperation on shared waters. This strategy aims to resolve the issues of river basins and aquifers shared between multiple countries without formal agreements. This is done by increasing mediation activities between such countries through the creation of\u00a0 designated institutions to address these issues.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last objective is to strengthen water sector governance, financing and institutions. This is done by improving upon environmental policies, building partnerships with other international organisations to support the development of water resources and increasing the amount of private and public resources mitigating water issues.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US government has set various approaches to fulfil these four strategies. Most notably, it plans to use its scientific and technical expertise to assist countries that require the most assistance for countering water risk. It also plans to mediate with governments and organisations to better understand the needs of the community while raising funds necessary for\u00a0 supporting the development of water and sanitation infrastructures.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strategy lists 13 \u2018High Priority Countries\u2019 that have high levels of water risk and assistance needs. Such countries include Afghanistan, Haiti, Indonesia and Uganda. The US will focus their attention on these countries, and have deliberated country-specific plans to better help these countries.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there are potential difficulties and risks that should be addressed. This is especially apparent for the third objective, where the US aims to reduce conflict by promoting cooperation on shared waters. It is extremely difficult for countries to agree and share water resources, especially in high-risk countries. Even if the US government is able to bring the conflicting parties together to discuss, it is unlikely that a formal consensus can be made immediately. In fact, greater conflict may arise when the two parties discuss formal conditions for cooperation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Drought and Climate Change<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China suffers from both too much as well as too little water due to climate change. Southern parts of China and coastal cities are often flooded fro<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">m typhoons, storm surges or river\/pluvial floods while certain areas experience extreme drought; for example, the middle and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is characterised by alternating periods of drought followed by floods.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over-extraction of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Groundwater\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">groundwater<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and falling water tables are significant problems in China- there is an average annual groundwater depletion rate of more than 10 billion cubic metres and water resource usage is set to peak in 2030 when the population also peaks. Groundwater extraction can lead to land subsidence- 60 000 sq kms of the ground surface in the country has sunk, with more than 50 cities suffering from severe land subsidence. Further, Asia\u2019s ten largest rivers, including the Yangtze, Yellow, Mekong and Ganges, are fed by seasonal melting, which is being affected by the climate crisis.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Existing drought models are very simplistic and therefore lead to wrong predictions.

The company has also made considerable effort to improve its track record in recent years, including releasing a\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fcf.com.tw\/fcf-unveils-tuna-sustainability-policy\/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new corporate social responsibility policy<\/a>\u00a0and participating in two Fishery Improvement Projects (FIPs), which are multi-stakeholder efforts to improve the environmental sustainability of particular fisheries.<\/p><p>But Greenpeace East Asia campaigner Pearl Chen told Mongabay in an email that FCF\u2019s efforts are insufficient and out of step with national and international standards. For example, she said the company\u2019s policy fails to specify a guaranteed amount of rest time for crew, which is not compatible with either Taiwan\u2019s domestic regulations or the International Labour Organization\u2019s\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ilo.org\/dyn\/normlex\/en\/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C188\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Work in Fishing convention<\/a>. Chen also pointed out that the FIPs that FCF participates in cover only a fifth of the longliners the company sources from, so its environmental commitments don\u2019t apply to most of its supply.<\/p><p>In response to a\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.greenpeace.org\/new-zealand\/publication\/misery-at-sea\/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2018 report<\/a>\u00a0from Greenpeace that also linked FCF to human rights abuses on longliner vessels, a company\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fcf.com.tw\/fcf-statement-on-recent-greenpeace-allegations\/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">statement<\/a>\u00a0said, \u201cwe are \u2026 disappointed that they are implicating FCF in old incidents and cases that have since been in all instances addressed in coordination with the Taiwanese Fisheries Department.\u201d<\/p><p>But the cases the new report cites are from 2019, Greenpeace senior oceans adviser Andy Shen told Mongabay. \u201cThese are fresh cases,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we wanted to let the public know \u2014 and let FCF know that we know \u2014 that this is still occurring, and it\u2019s occurring because there are systemic issues with the Taiwanese industry.\u201d<\/p><p><strong>Lost at Sea<\/strong><\/p><p>The distant-water fishing industry is difficult to regulate because the vessels spend long stretches in remote parts of the ocean. Instead of returning to port when they\u2019ve fished to capacity, many longliners offload their catch onto other boats that deliver it to shore, a practice known as transhipment at sea. \u201cSo they can stay out for months or years at a time,\u201d Shen said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no way to check on the real conditions of workers when they\u2019re at sea.\u201d Greenpeace and other prominent environmental and human rights organizations have called for transhipment at sea to be banned so companies and authorities can keep better track of the fishing and labor practices on distant-water vessels. In its latest report, Greenpeace also asks companies to ensure their suppliers commit to maximum periods of time at sea and to returning to ports that have labor inspection systems in place.<\/p><p>According to independent fisheries consultant Francisco Blaha, a former longline tuna fisher and fisheries observer, many island countries have been pushing for a ban on transhipment at sea for years, but China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan have consistently opposed the move. \u201cSo this is not an issue of FCF per se,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that goes beyond the company and it goes to the level of politics, of flag states\u2019 relationships.\u201d<\/p><p>Labor conditions are further obscured by the international nature of the workforce, Blaha said. \u201cIn the past, the flag of the vessel and the crew of the vessel were the same [nationality],\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s not the case anymore.\u201d Taiwanese vessel owners often contract crew agents to recruit workers from neighboring countries, such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Myanmar. Theoretically, Taiwanese labor laws, which include a minimum monthly wage, apply to anyone working on a Taiwanese-flagged vessel. \u201cBut if [those crew agents] offer less pay than what the law says, it\u2019s quite difficult for Taiwan to put pressure on them,\u201d Blaha said, \u201cespecially because Indonesia doesn\u2019t recognize Taiwan as a country.\u201d<\/p><p>Shen said he would like to see companies like FCF enact policies ensuring that each vessel supplying the company is assessed for human rights violations, that each violation is addressed and measures put in place to prevent future occurrences, and that the companies publicly report on their findings to ensure transparency. \u201cThat\u2019s a system that a lot of companies just don\u2019t have in place, but it\u2019s something that makes sense, and it ultimately will protect the workers and it will protect their business,\u201d he said.<\/p><p>But Blaha said he thought Greenpeace\u2019s focus on FCF was misguided. \u201cThe issue of work conditions on vessels is massive, but it\u2019s not exclusive to one company. Of course the company has influence, because it\u2019s a big company, but there is a limit to the influence it can have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of the whole fisheries spectrum, from regulators, to industry, to civil society and consumers. If you point fingers at just one element you\u2019ll just antagonize them, and nothing gets solved.\u201d<\/p><p><strong>Pandemic Planning<\/strong><\/p><p>Shen and Blaha agreed on one thing: now is a particularly important time to spotlight the tuna industry\u2019s fishers and factory workers\u2019 conditions. Because food production is deemed an essential service in many countries, these employees will be under pressure to continue working as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads. \u201cCompanies need to really ensure they\u2019re putting measures in place, including occupational safety and health measures and special protective equipment: measures to really help prevent the spread of the virus within these facilities,\u201d Shen said.<\/p><p>But it will be challenging for the industry to keep up with demand in this context, Blaha said. \u201cIf you need to do social distancing in the factories, production will go down, because people there are normally working shoulder to shoulder,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if people are getting sick, that\u2019s fewer people on the front lines.\u201d If production slows down, lots of fish will be lost, he said, because there\u2019s not enough freezer capacity to store it while it\u2019s waiting to be processed.<\/p><p>Fishers may also be reluctant to take observers and inspectors on board their vessels for fear of catching the virus from them, Blaha said. In fact, the requirement for purse seiner tuna boats to have 100% observer coverage has\u00a0<a data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/www.seafoodsource.com\/news\/supply-trade\/pna-suspends-observers-coverage-requirement-for-tuna-fleet-amid-covid-19-pandemic\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">just been suspended\u00a0<\/a>in parts of the Pacific Ocean, in light of crews\u2019 concerns. It\u2019s an understandable move, but one that works against the advance of transparency in an industry that operates far beyond the horizon.<\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>Featured image by: <a href=\"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Canned_and_packaged_tuna_on_supermarket_shelves.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Case<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><em>This article was <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2020\/04\/pandemic-staple-report-links-top-tuna-company-to-forced-labor-illegal-fishing\/\" target=\"_blank\">originally published on Mongabay<\/a>, written by Monica Evans, and is republished here as part of an editorial partnership with Earth.Org.\u00a0<\/em><\/em><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/report-links-top-tuna-company-to-forced-labor-illegal-fishing\/"},"Page 28":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">\u2018Green Snow\u2019 is Spreading Across Antarctica: What Does it Mean?<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/polar-regions\">Polar Regions<\/a> <\/span><span>May 29th 2020<\/span><span>3 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"\u2018Green Snow\u2019 is Spreading Across Antarctica: What Does it Mean?\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-05-29T093230.917.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"\u2018Green Snow\u2019 is Spreading Across Antarctica: What Does it Mean?\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Webp.net-resizeimage-2020-05-29T093230.917.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><strong>Algae blooms are causing \u2018green snow\u2019 along the coastlines of Antarctica and are likely to spread as temperatures rise, according to a study that has created the first large-scale map of the organisms and their movements.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>What is green snow?<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>T<\/strong>he study, published in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-020-16018-w.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nature Communications<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> journal, used European Space Agency satellite data gathered between 2017 and 2019 as well as on-the-ground observations over two summers in Antarctica\u2019s Ryder Bay, Adelaide Island, the Fildes Peninsula and King George Island, which allowed scientists to map the microscopic algae as they spread across the snow of the Antarctic Peninsula, forming \u2018green snow\u2019.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The data reported is a conservative estimate since it only included green algae.

He says, \u201cAs bird- particularly penguin- populations are affected by warming temperatures, the snow algae could lose sources of nutrients to grow.\u201d Over 60% of blooms were found near penguin colonies and others were found near birds\u2019 nesting sites.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr Gray says that an increase in the blooms could also lead to further snow melt. \u201cIt\u2019s very dark- a green snow algal bloom will reflect about 80% of the light hitting it, so it will increase the rate of snow melt in a localised area,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers found that almost two-thirds of the bloom were on small, low-lying islands. The researchers say that as the region warms due to the climate crisis, these islands could lose their summer snow cover and algae- although in terms of mass, the majority of snow algae is found in areas where they can spread to higher ground when snow melts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Antarctic Peninsula is the part of the region that has experienced the most rapid warming in the latter part of the last century, the researchers say.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The region experienced an unprecedented heatwave in the beginning of the year- on February 9, a research station recorded a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/antarctica-heatwave\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">temperature of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20.75\u00b0C<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the continent\u2019s first time to exceed <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20\u00b0C in recorded history.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The algal blooms in Antarctica are equivalent to about the amount of carbon that\u2019s being omitted by 875 000 average UK petrol car journeys.

Flying also requires a huge amount of activity for bats, which has caused their immune systems to become very specialised.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrew Cunningham, Professor of Wildlife Epidemiology at the Zoological Society of London, says, \u201cWhen they fly they have a peak body temperature that mimics a fever. It happens at least twice a day with bats- when they fly out to feed and then they return to roost. And so the pathogens that have evolved in bats are able to withstand these peaks of body temperature.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This could present a problem when these diseases cross into another species. In humans, a fever is a defense mechanism designed to raise the body temperature to kill a virus. A virus that has evolved in a bat will likely not be affected by a higher body temperature.<\/span><\/p><p><b><i>You might also like:<\/i><\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/20000km-of-new-roads-will-be-built-in-tiger-habitats-by-2050-study\/\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>Over 20 000km of New Roads Will Be Built in Tiger Habitats by 2050- Study<\/i><\/b><\/a><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 has been framed as a virus which bats spread to us- we are the victims.

When bats are stressed- by being hunted, by being kept in wetmarkets or having its habitat damaged by deforestation- its immune system is challenged and finds it harder to cope with the pathogens it harbours.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cunningham says, \u201cIt would allow infections to increase and to be excreted- to be shed.

In these precarious times, animals should not suffer further at the hands of humans because of paranoia. As Sir David Attenborough<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/inews.co.uk\/culture\/television\/david-attenborough-quotes-93rd-birthday-502390\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary how self-obsessed human beings are. There is so much more out there than what connects to us\u201d. The knowledge and awareness of our bigoted views towards animals is essential for our proper coexistence with nature.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><strong>Why are bats important?<\/strong><\/p><p><b>Importance of Bats: Pest Control<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bats eat insects which are considered pests to humans. Insects make up two-thirds of bats\u2019 diets and they are able to consume (at least) a<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/isrn\/2013\/187415\/\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quarter of their body mass in insects nightly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This ferocious appetite is important in protecting crops, making bats an essential part of the global food system. In Indonesia, the exclusion of bats could cause up to a<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/257888111_Bats_and_birds_increase_crop_yield_in_tropical_agroforestry_landscapes\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30% decrease in cocoa harvests<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Without them, many of the crops meant for us would be eaten by insects instead.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/50939997_Economic_Importance_of_Bats_in_Agriculture\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other indirect benefits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including the ecological benefits of not using pesticides, must also be considered.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, bats devour those pests that harm our health. Bats are famous for their<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jmammal\/article\/99\/3\/668\/4993282\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mosquito hunting prowess<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While mosquitoes do not directly kill humans, they are hosts for many diseases such as Malaria, Dengue fever and Zika virus. It is estimated by the World Health Organization that<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-36320744\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">725 000 people die of mosquito-borne diseases annually<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As the natural predator of insects, including mosquitoes, bats help to control the mosquito population, protecting our health in the process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Importance of Bats: Pollination\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some bats prey on insects, others feast on fruits and nectar.

To the many plants that rely on bats to pollinate their flowers and disperse their seeds, this is the polar opposite. Such plants include agave, durian, wild bananas, breadfruit and mango. Durians are<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/isrn\/2013\/187415\/\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exclusively pollinated by bats<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They do so by producing<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/singapore\/what-has-bats-got-to-do-with-durians\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> odours that attract bats and hanging their flowers upside down to make it more accessible for<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">them.

Not only do bats increase the quantity of fruits, they can also influence its quality.

It identifies major drivers of food loss further down the supply chain, which include poor disease and pest management, over-importation of food items and inadequate infrastructure.<\/span><\/p><p><em><strong>You might also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/tackling-the-food-waste-crisis-in-china\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tackling the Food Waste Crisis in China<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of those surveyed in the study, about one third said they throw away 10% or more of uncooked and unconsumed food items per week.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The study also found that 342 000 tonnes of food is lost in Singapore before it reaches retail and consumers, 49% of this from the loss of fruits and vegetables.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Singapore Environment Council Chairman Isabella Huang-Loh, says, \u201cMore can be done in an industrialised country like Singapore to reduce food loss.

The campaign says that food waste is one of the biggest waste streams in Singapore and that the amount of food waste generated has grown by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/singapore\/nea-launches-year-long-battle-against-food-wastage\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40% in the last decade<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In 2018, the country generated 763 million kgs of food waste, making up half of the average 1.5kgs of waste disposed of by each household in Singapore daily. Rice, noodles and bread are the most commonly wasted food items.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wasting food means that more food has to be sourced to meet demand, affecting food security since Singapore imports over 90% of its food supply. It also means that the Republic will need to build more waste disposal facilities, such as waste-to-energy plants and landfills for incineration ash, a difficult task for land-scarce Singapore.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To conserve resources, food wastage must be minimised and unavoidable food waste must be treated, starting with avoiding wastage and excess food production (or re-distributing excess food) and then segregating food waste for recycling and treatment. Singapore is working on this issue through publicity and outreach programmes, where it educates consumers on how to adopt smart food purchasing, storage and preparation habits, as well as providing food manufacturers and retailers with handbooks to help them develop a food minimisation plan that suits them. Further, it is building up local research and development capabilities to discover innovative ways to recycle food waste.<\/span><\/p><p><b>What is Being Done?<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of legislation, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nea.gov.sg\/our-services\/waste-management\/3r-programmes-and-resources\/food-waste-management\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resource Sustainability Act <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mandates that from 2024, large commercial and industrial food waste generators will be required to segregate food waste for treatment, including hotels and malls, as well as food storage warehouses manufacturers.

The collapse of these ice sheets would raise sea levels by many metres. The Gulf Stream current in the Atlantic, which warms Europe, has slowed by 15% since the mid-20th century.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-019-03595-0\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">17%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the Amazon rainforest has been lost since 1970. The tipping point where loss of forest leads to it drying out, could lie in the 20-40% range, which could turn some regions from a sink for carbon to a <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/tropical-forests-are-losing-their-ability-to-store-carbon\/\" target=\"_blank\">source<\/a>. In the tropics, corals are predicted to be wiped out by 2C of heating.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cascade of tipping points could occur because, for example, the melting of Arctic sea ice amplifies heating by exposing dark ocean that absorbs more sunlight. This may increase the melting of Greenland ice and permafrost areas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two physical tipping points which have received less attention will be discussed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examples of these tipping points are starting to be observed, the scientists say. For example, Arctic sea-ice loss is amplifying warming in the region, and Arctic warming and Greenland melting are driving an influx of fresh water into the North Atlantic, where the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-019-03595-0\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is responsible for bringing warm water to mid-latitude regions and is a key part of global heat and salt transport by the ocean.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The positive feedback is brought about by the current towards the north transporting salty water, which then sinks in the north and flows back to the south to complete the loop. With the melting Greenland ice sheet, the freshwater dilutes the salty water and makes it lighter. This reduces the sinking. With the loop slowing down, less salty water is brought northward and makes the sinking even slower. Rapid melting of the Greenland ice sheet and further slowdown of the AMOC could destabilise the West African monsoon, triggering drought in the Sahel region. The slowdown could also dry out the Amazon, disrupt the East Asian monsoon and cause heat to build up in the Southern Ocean, which could accelerate Antarctic ice loss.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been suggested that the AMOC tipping point is unlikely to be reached if the Paris Agreement is adhered to. If this tipping point is exceeded, Europe may experience disrupted rainfall patterns and have knock-on effects for agriculture.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, professor of physics of the oceans at Potsdam University, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.carbonbrief.org\/explainer-nine-tipping-points-that-could-be-triggered-by-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201cMost people think that to trigger a real shutdown would require substantial global warming- like 3C or 4C [above pre-industrial levels]. And we could pretty well minimise this risk by limiting the warming to below 2C. So, if we actually take the Paris Agreement seriously, then I would feel relatively relaxed about the risk of a shutdown. But if we continue on the current path and heading for three or more degrees, then this becomes a really serious concern.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another tipping point lies at the other end of the world. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) rests on an underwater bedrock. Warmer water underneath the sheet melting it from below reduces the contact area and friction between the WAIS and the bedrock, speeding up the outward flow of the WAIS. This further stretches and thins the sheet, exacerbating the melting. It has been estimated that the tipping point lies near <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.carbonbrief.org\/explainer-nine-tipping-points-that-could-be-triggered-by-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two degrees of global warming<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since pre-industrial levels.

At present, many companies are failing to disclose the additional costs needed for limited warming. If companies disclose these financial burdens, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/364\/6436\/132\/tab-pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their values may drop<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Renewables used to be more expensive than fossil fuels, but with increased investment, costs of solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind have been reduced drastically. Meanwhile, the costs of fossil fuels and nuclear energy have remained consistent. Costs of PV and wind energy can now compete with their cheapest alternatives, these being oil, coal and natural gas. Once the costs drop below a certain point, renewables may be more widely adopted. More investment will follow, leading to further cost reductions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/364\/6436\/132\/tab-pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">social sector may benefit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from climate tipping points. Studies have shown how a small number of influencers in a large group of people can have a snowballing effect for pro-climate activism. With climate news frequently making headlines, the pro-climate population is growing. While people are becoming more aware of the climate emergency, many are silent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the relatively small number of influencers- or committed minority- can demonstrate to the silent yet pro-climate majority that their beliefs are more widely held than they thought, more of the population will be encouraged to be outspoken about the issue. As the population of the committed minority grows, eventually this will result in a committed majority. This will activate another tipping point where political leaders worldwide may pay more attention to the pro-climate voting population.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To activate this tipping point requires both a sufficiently large proportion of silent pro-climate population as well as enough committed minorities. While mainstream news agencies are helping to grow the latent silent pro-climate population, political influencers like Greta Thunberg are also essential to engage the latent potential.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preliminary results from the latest climate models suggest that global heating will be greater than expected, increasing the risk of tipping points. Climate tipping points are no doubt an emergency that need to be studied to be avoided, and we need to better utilise the positive socioeconomic tipping points to mitigate the climate crisis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"has-small-font-size\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Featured image by: <a class=\"owner-name truncate\" data-track=\"attributionNameClick\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sinzianag\/27493565555\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Go to Sinziana Gafitanu's photostream\">Sinziana Gafitanu<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/img><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/what-are-tipping-points-in-the-climate-crisis\/"},"Page 35":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/conservation\">Conservation<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Tropical Forests Are Losing Their Ability to Store Carbon<\/h1><div class=\"meta\"> <span>by <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/author\/admin\/\">Earth.Org<\/a><\/span><span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/africa\">Africa<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/location\/americas\">Americas<\/a> <\/span><span>Apr 1st 2020<\/span><span>3 mins<\/span><\/div><div class=\"story__content__social top_single_social\"><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div class=\"share-donate btn\"><svg style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 100 100;\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 100 100\" x=\"0px\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" y=\"0px\"> <path d=\"M18.3,67.3c4.7,0,8.9-1.9,12-4.9l34.3,17.1c-0.1,0.7-0.1,1.4-0.1,2.1c0,9.6,7.7,17.3,17.3,17.3S99,91.3,99,81.7 s-7.7-17.3-17.3-17.3c-4.7,0-8.9,1.9-12,4.9L35.4,52.1c0.1-0.7,0.1-1.4,0.1-2.1s-0.1-1.4-0.1-2.1l34.3-17.1c3.1,3,7.3,4.9,12,4.9 c9.6,0,17.3-7.7,17.3-17.3S91.3,1,81.7,1S64.4,8.7,64.4,18.3c0,0.7,0.1,1.4,0.1,2.1L30.3,37.6c-3.1-3-7.3-4.9-12-4.9 C8.7,32.7,1,40.4,1,50S8.7,67.3,18.3,67.3z\" style=\"fill:#ffffff\"><\/path> <\/svg><div>Share \u00b7 Boost<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>","content":"<section class=\"post_image\"> <img alt=\"Tropical Forests Are Losing Their Ability to Store Carbon\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Webp.net-resizeimage-57.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\"\/><noscript><img alt=\"Tropical Forests Are Losing Their Ability to Store Carbon\" src=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Webp.net-resizeimage-57.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/section><section class=\"post-content\"><p><b>New research shows that <\/b><b>tropical forests are taking up less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing their ability to act as \u2018carbon sinks\u2019 and instead becoming sources of carbon.

Polar bears as an example will have to spend more time foraging for food on land or risk unstable sea ice or open water.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As species from the south relocate northward in search of colder climates, they are likely to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenfacts.org\/glossary\/pqrs\/species.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">displace<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Arctic species (who are unable to migrate northward because of the Arctic Ocean).<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, expected increases in human activity, such as offshore oil and gas drilling and trans-Atlantic shipping will affect the animals living in these areas.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improved monitoring will be important for improving these animals\u2019 population status by continuously developing adaptive management and conservation policies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most recent IPCC projection for sea level rise by 2100 is approximately 0.5m even under an emissions mitigation scenario. This rise can be mostly attributed to thermal expansion of ocean water and melting mountain glaciers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warming above a \u2018survival\u2019 threshold, previously estimated as 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures, may cause loss of most of the Greenland ice sheet (GiS) over the following centuries. The collapse of the Thwaites Glacier and other Antarctic water sources could contribute more than 3m to global sea level rise over less than a century. Further warming could extend these processes into marine basins of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), potentially adding an additional 12m or more of sea level rise further in the future. Geoengineering solutions have been proposed, but grave difficulties remain.<\/span><\/p><p><b>Extreme Weather at Lower Latitudes\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased warming associated with sea-ice loss may increase the probability of the Northern Hemisphere experiencing more deadly heatwaves and wildfires, among other extreme weather events. The California drought of 2011- 2017 has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.climatesignals.org\/headlines\/events\/california-drought-2012-2016\" target=\"_blank\">linked<\/a> to changing arctic conditions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Thawing Permafrost Emitting Methane<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Methane <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has 30 times the heat-trapping capacity of carbon dioxide<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Future warming could substantially increase these methane emissions from wetlands and permafrost decomposition, serving as a positive feedback to warming of the global climate system. Under business-as-usual emissions, total wetland areas will increase by 13% by 2100, and <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/methane-levels-have-risen-to-highest-on-record\/\" target=\"_blank\">global methane emissions<\/a> will nearly double relative to current levels.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Vegetation Shifts\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Climate change is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenfacts.org\/en\/arctic-climate-change\/l-3\/4-arctic-tundra.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">projected<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to cause vegetation shifts because rising temperatures favour taller, denser vegetation, and will thus promote the expansion of forests into the arctic tundra, and tundra into the polar deserts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This process will cause a decrease in surface reflectivity, amplifying global warming because the newly forested areas will be darker and more textured and thus will absorb more solar radiation than the lighter, cooler tundra. Additionally, expanding forests mask highly reflective snow.

Additionally, Australia allowed itself an 8% increase in its emissions in the first Kyoto commitment period compared to 1990 and a 0.5% reduction for the second; Australia is now claiming \u2018overachieving\u2019 after choosing less ambitious targets than other countries.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Australia succeeds in using these carryover credits, it would reduce the country\u2019s 2030 reduction target from 26% to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tai.org.au\/sites\/default\/files\/Climate%20Analytics%20-%20Kyoto%20Carryover%20In%20Madrid.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13.9%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> below 2005 emission levels using 2019 projections.

Since 1997, Bolivia has claimed that the watercourse, which derives from Bolivia and crosses into Chile, belongs exclusively to Bolivia and is not international. Conversely, Chile insists it has a legal right to use the water and asserts the Silala is an international river. For international water law to apply, an international watercourse must be naturally occurring; however, Bolivia claims that the disputed river would not run to Chile without man-made canals constructed in the early 1900s. Hence, in Bolivia\u2019s view, the Silala is not a natural transboundary watercourse. As international water law cannot apply, Bolivia states it can exploit its waters exclusively. The river meanders through one of the driest parts of the world, which strengthens the desire of both countries to claim rights over its use. This dispute is emblematic of a wider global problem. Water scarcity due to climate change and increased consumption are straining freshwater supply, opening the floodgates to a more assertive water-driven foreign policy and international posturing by nations.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u2014<\/strong><\/p><p><b>The Silala River Dispute: \u201cThe most vulnerable basin on the continent\u201d<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Silala is a current example of how political, socio-economic and environmental forces fuel competition for resources.

Water, a scarce resource in the Atacama Desert, aimed to power steam engines that traveled between the cities of Antofagasta in Chile and Oruro in Bolivia. Bolivia claims that Chile built up canals that moved the river\u2019s natural flow artificially from Bolivia to Chile. In 1962, steam-powered engines were replaced by diesel engines and water was no longer needed to power the latter. Since then, Chile has retained control of the water course, channelling its flow to supply mines and towns, even though the concession was initially given to power locomotives only.

Hence, because of the underlying geopolitical and economic issues, the Silala has become one of the most vulnerable basins in the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Geopolitical and Natural Challenges to International Water Law<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In June 2016, the United Nation\u2019s highest court, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.icj-cij.org\/en\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International Court of Justice<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (ICJ), has assessed a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.icj-cij.org\/files\/case-related\/162\/19018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">legal case<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> concerning the Silala river. The lawsuit is still <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.icj-cij.org\/en\/case\/162\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ongoing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. On the one hand, Bolivia claims ownership of the Silala as the river originates from springs on its territory. The country believes it can exploit the river and charge the riparian State for its use. On the other hand, Chile insists it has a sovereign right to the Silala, an international watercourse which had never been diverted from its springs but instead naturally canalised. The applicability of international water law to the Silala case depends on whether or not the Silala River is described as a <em>natural transboundary watercourse<\/em>. Human-altered canalisation and flow deviations would not fall within the rubric of international water law.<\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should the river be considered an international boundary, it would prevent Bolivia from using the river\u2019s waters without sharing them with Chile. It would, instead, entail an equitable utilisation of the watercourse as well as a duty of cooperation with its neighbour. These principles have been codified in <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/legal.un.org\/ilc\/texts\/instruments\/english\/conventions\/8_3_1997.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the 1997 United Nations Convention on the Law of Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> whose fifth article states that \u201cwatercourse States shall participate in the use, development and protection of an international watercourse in an equitable and reasonable manner. Such participation includes both the right to utilise the watercourse and the duty to cooperate in the protection and development thereof\u201d. Hence, Chile would have the right to a \u201creasonable and equitable\u201d share of the river. It is noteworthy that Bolivia has not ratified the Convention.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, Bolivia argues for its supreme sovereignty over the use of the Silala. Bolivia\u2019s view might well refer to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unescwa.org\/harmon-doctrine\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harmon doctrine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a principle stating that, in the name of the absolute sovereignty over its natural resources, \u201can upstream country has the unrestricted right to use the water of an international river irrespective of downstream consequences\u201d. Yet, Bolivia\u2019s argumentation is not based on this doctrine but rather on the qualification of the Silala as a domestic and not an international one, which enables the country to refuse any obligation towards Chile. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International law may not have a solution to a political problem. Furthermore, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unwater.org\/water-facts\/human-rights\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">human right to water<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may relativise the relevance of the legal qualification of the Silala river as a domestic or an international watercourse. Bolivia may have extraterritorial obligations towards the riparian State as its absolute right to use Silala waters might have consequences on people living in Chile who rely on the Silala for domestic uses. Negotiations between the two countries remain a back seat while the lawsuit continues, although talks may come to the most optimal solution for this hydro-politically vulnerable basin.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Water is a Scarce Resource in the Region<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Silala dispute highlights that water is an increasingly contentious resource, as a result of climate change and increased demands from population and industry. In 2016, Bolivia found itself in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2016\/nov\/21\/bolivia-drought-state-of-emergency-water-shortages\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a national state of emergency<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to a drought brought by a very intense El Ni\u00f1o. Even in unexceptional circumstances, Bolivia and Chile regularly face drought-induced water shortages.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Silala flows across the Bolivian-Chilean border in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places in the world. The Atacama receives 15 millimeters of rain on average per year. Underground water basins around the desert are depleting due to excessive exploitation. Intensive mining activities in the region are severely straining available water resources. In Chile, water is considered an economic good,\u00a0 bought and sold on a private water market at a relatively low price, with little governmental regulation and management. Mining companies can buy as many water contracts as they want. This cheap resource is not considered as an important capital until it is run out. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Dieter Helm, an economist and Professor at the University of Oxford, natural resources, such as water, should be considered a form of \u201c<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dieterhelm.co.uk\/natural-capital\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">natural capital<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d to be valued alongside human and financial capital, with an intrinsic economic price, not just as an unpriceable necessity. If natural capital keeps being provided for free, the argument goes, people, companies and governments will not have any incentive to moderate their use. Pricing natural capital as well as damage to it, would represent a viable solution, placing water at the centre of economic and political future of the Atacama region.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolivia has recognised the climate crisis as one of the top risks for the country\u2019s future. Its population is rising, while the Andean glaciers that don its high peaks are shrinking dramatically. According to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.the-cryosphere.net\/10\/2399\/2016\/tc-10-2399-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published in The Cryosphere, a European Geosciences Union scientific journal, the glaciers of Bolivia shrank by 43% between 1986 and 2014. Glaciers are in retreat as the world warms, a consequence of rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in response to the increasing combustion of fossil fuels. Shrinking glaciers will significantly impact downstream communities that are dependent on meltwater from glaciers, particularly during the dry season. Increasing temperatures and river streamflow reductions will make rural people increasingly vulnerable in areas already plagues by antiquated farming methods and poor yields.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">River-related conflicts are becoming one of the leading causes of tension between countries that suffer from water scarcity and global warming. The Sialala transboundary freshwater dispute, intensified by extreme droughts, shrinking glaciers and management challenges, has the potential to escalate antagonisms in the Andean region. The issues that ground this typical case expand beyond water rights. They involve a competition for resources, strengthened by water scarcity. Hence, while there may be water rights at stake before the International Court of Justice, the Silala dispute is also concerned with allocating economic and political interests in a situation of climate crisis scenario. Water scarcity in both countries is likely to intensify claims of absolute territorial sovereignty over the river instead of promoting adroit management and equal rights. The outcome of this legal case may be crucial to future Chile-Bolivian relations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><em>This article is part of a series published jointly with <a href=\"https:\/\/globalriskinsights.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Risk Insights (GRI)<\/a> a leading geopolitical online news-source.

Farmers depend on the regular seasonality of harvests that for millennia has regulated crop growth and given rhythm to countryside life. However, climate change is altering rainfall patterns around the world. When temperatures rise, the warmer air holds more moisture and can make precipitation more intense. Extreme precipitation events, which are becoming more common, can directly damage crops, decreasing yields.<\/p><p>Global warming enables weeds, pests, and fungi to expand their range and numbers. In addition, earlier springs and milder winters allow more of these pests and weeds to survive for a longer time. Plant diseases and pests that are new to an area could destroy crops that haven\u2019t had time to evolve defenses against them.<\/p><p>Hotter weather will lead to faster evaporation, <a aria-label=\"resulting in more droughts (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/are-we-running-out-of-water\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">resulting in more droughts <\/a>and water shortages\u2014so there will be less water for irrigation just when it is needed most. The ultimate effect of rising heat depends on each crop\u2019s optimal range of temperatures for growth and reproduction. If temperatures exceed this range, yields will drop because heat stress can disrupt a plant\u2019s pollination, flowering, root development, and growth stages.<\/p><p>There needs to be a global coordinated effort to ensure that the world\u2019s most vulnerable will not run out of food; food insecurity is becoming a more pressing concern as climate change affects global food production, and these vulnerable people will be the first to suffer.<\/p><\/section>","URL":"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change-is-already-affecting-global-food-production\/"},"Page 46":{"title":"<section class=\"post-hero\"><div class=\"category\"> <span> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/climate-change\">Climate Change<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/solutions\">Solutions<\/a> <\/span><\/div><h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">Smart Farms?

Meanwhile, a California-based startup is capturing CO<sub>2<\/sub> for the production of bioplastics, in a collaboration with the furniture giant IKEA.<\/p><p>Many of these innovations are still in the early stages of development.<\/p><p><strong>Reframing carbon as an \u201casset\u201d and driver of economic growth<\/strong><\/p><p>In the report <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.curc.net\/webfiles\/Making%20Carbon%20a%20Commodity\/180724%20Making%20Carbon%20a%20Commodity%20FINAL%20with%20color.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Making Carbon a Commodity<\/a>, the authors suggest that carbon is an economic commodity that could add $190 billion to US GDP by 2040 and create 780, 000 jobs through enhanced oil recovery.<\/p><p>89 billion barrels of additional oil are trapped in onshore reservoirs, the US Department of Energy estimates \u2013 in stark contrast to the country\u2019s current proven domestic reserves of 21.9 billion barrels.<\/p><p>Enhanced oil recovery methods can tap in to this production, according to the Department, increasing the country\u2019s oil recovery from approximately 30% to 60%.<\/p><p>Carbon capture can be an attractive option for developing countries that face conflicting priorities in balancing energy needs and emissions reductions.<\/p><p>China is the <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/1157788\/china-is-the-acid-test-for-a-technology-that-could-save-the-world-from-catastrophic-climate-change\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">perfect testing ground<\/a> for large-scale deployment of carbon capture technology, experts say. The country is developing their own CCUS technology and has 9 carbon-capture projects in pilot stage.<\/p><p>As the world\u2019s top energy consumer and CO<sub>2 <\/sub>emitter accounting for 30% of global emissions, China not only needs carbon capture, but is well-equipped to implement its mass-scale deployment with heavy-handed governments and state-owned enterprises.<\/p><p>Sinopec, one of China\u2019s largest oil and gas companies, uses enhanced oil recovery on Shengli oilfield, located in the Yellow River delta in Shandong province. Shengli is the second-largest oilfield in China and became depleted after peak production in the 1990s.<\/p><p>By capturing CO<sub>2<\/sub> and pumping it in the ground, Sinopec is now increasing the field\u2019s yield, while recovering CO<sub>2<\/sub> from the atmosphere.<\/p><p>In the absence other financial incentives to cut emissions, enhanced oil recovery is a selling point for carbon capture technology. EOR can be effective pathway for China and other developing nations to maximise their own oil production capacity.<\/p><p><strong>Unlocking funding opportunities for carbon capture technology <\/strong><\/p><p>While carbon capture is technologically feasible, it has a Catch-22 type of funding problem.<\/p><p>Without incentives to cut emissions in the form of a tax credits or carbon dividends, banks are less likely to appraise a CCUS project as economically feasible. Yet if the costs of carbon capture were lower, its mass deployment could be profitable.<\/p><p>CURC and Clearpath Foundation advocate for the increase in use of public-private partnerships (PPPs) to develop and scale up early-stage carbon capture technologies, addressing the major challenge of carbon capture: the large capital investment required. \u00a0<\/p><p>The US Department of Energy could play a crucial role in funding PPPs, as it did in the case of the Petra Nova plant in Texas, the first and only carbon-capture unit in the US installed on a coal-fired power plant. The Department oversees federal efforts to advance the deployment of CCUS technology and is an important proponent of carbon capture R&amp;D and financing.<\/p><p>Shifting the public\u2019 awareness of CCUS is also important for its roll-out. \u201cCCS doesn\u2019t make anything new\u2026 People don\u2019t tend to see it as something additive; they tend to see it as something subtractive.\u201d, says CCS expert Julio Friedmann. \u201cThat\u2019s why people tend to look at it as a cost, as opposed to an investment.
