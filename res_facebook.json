But the calving of one, maybe two, large icebergs is inevitable. The question is: when? Ice scientists are watching to see if a rapidly accelerating crack will cause the shelf to rip apart before the sunlit summer season ends.\n\nThe Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 acquired this image of the Brunt Ice Shelf on January 12, 2021. The ice flows away from the Antarctic mainland and floats on the eastern Weddell Sea. The main shelf area has long been home to the British Antarctic Survey\u2019s Halley Research Station, from which scientists study Earth, atmospheric, and space weather processes.\n\nThe breaking, or \u201ccalving,\u201d of icebergs from ice shelves is part of a natural, cyclical process of growth and decay at the limits of Earth\u2019s ice sheets. As glacial ice flows from land and spreads out over the sea, shelf areas farthest from shore grow thinner. These areas are stretched thin, and can be melted from above or below, making them more prone to forming rifts and eventually breaking away. The Brunt Ice Shelf appears to be in a period of instability, with cracks spreading across its surface.\n\nThe major rifts are visible in the wide view at the top of this page. In late October 2016, the \u201cHalloween crack\u201d appeared and rapidly extended eastward. In early 2019, Chasm 1 extended northward as fast as 4 kilometers per year. Now, a new crack is zippering across the shelf north of the Halloween crack, far faster than the fissure to its south.\n\nThe detailed view shows the new rift growing away from an area known as the McDonald Ice Rumples. The rift shows up in satellite images as early as September 2019, when it had grown just over 2 kilometers longer during the austral winter. But the biggest growth just occurred recently. Between November 18 and December 22, 2020, the rift grew in length by about 20 kilometers. Then it jogged toward the north and grew an additional 8 kilometers by January 12, 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to know exactly what caused this new rift to extend so quickly,\u201d said Christopher Shuman, a University of Maryland, Baltimore County, glaciologist based at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that fracture dynamics near the McDonald Ice Rumples played a role, as they did in the quick propagation of the \u2018Halloween Crack\u2019 in 2016. The unusual mix of ice blocks and m\u00e9lange in this part of the Brunt Ice Shelf \u2018system\u2019 is another factor.\u201d\n\nThe rumples are the result of ice that flows over an underwater formation, where the bedrock rises high enough to reach into the underside of the floating ice shelf. This rocky formation impedes the flow of ice and causes pressure waves, crevasses, and rifts to form at the surface.\n\nAll of these cracks, combined with a recent speed up at the leading edge of the ice shelf (detected by ESA\u2019s Sentinel-1), point to an instability that is likely to spawn a new iceberg or two. The exact timing is uncertain, but until the break occurs and the shelf has been reformed, Halley Research Station is being kept minimally staffed for safety reasons. In 2016-2017, the Halley VI station was relocated to a safer location (Halley VIa) upstream of the then-growing Chasm 1.\n\n\u201cI think we are going to see big changes here,\u201d Shuman said. And with more than two months left of sunlight, changes should be visible in natural-color satellite images for a while longer before the onset of winter darkness.\n\nRead more on NASA Earth Observatory: https:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/images\/147799\/brunt-breaking-up-with-antarctica-this-year","post_text":"","shared_text":"NASA Earth\n19 January at 15:00 \u00b7\n\nBrunt Breaking Up with Antarctica this Year?\n\nTwo years after the Brunt Ice Shelf seemed poised to produce a berg twice the size of New York City, the ice is still hanging on.

In the summer, our grass turns a beautiful golden color all over the state. Rolling, golden hills will always mean \"home\" to me. Even if California's forests were \"raked\" daily, the fires would still be happening.\nThe state of California manages just 3% of our forest land. The federal government manages most of it. Think about that for a moment.\nIf you lived in California in the 80s, you might remember people saying that California would basically burn down every year if we did not do something about \"global warming,\" as we called it at the time. And here we are.\nCalifornia is huge. We have the world's fifth largest economy, surpassed only by the US as a whole, China, Japan, and Germany. California's economy is larger than every other nation on earth. When you hear that we're \"failing\" and a \"shithole,\" that's political propaganda. Economically, geographically, and demographically, we are one of the most diverse political entities on the planet.\nThis means that very little you can say about California applies to the state as a whole. Life in San Francisco resembles life in London more than it resembles life in Bakersfield. Part of the beauty and allure of California is that, no matter what you want, we have it. Metropolitan cities are an hour away from rolling farmland, which is an hour away from the desert, which is a few hours away from snow-capped mountains. Get in your car and drive in any direction for a few hours and you'll see six different Californias.\nPeople come here from all over the world, and that's our strength. We are your future-- no one race or ethnicity has a majority here, although Latinx people have the plurality, which will soon be true for America as a whole. But even \"Latinx\" is a category so broad as to be almost meaningless. California was once Mexico, so people of Mexican descent have always had the demographic upper hand, but you can't pick up a square mile of California anywhere without getting Salvadorans and Guatemalans in that mix, along with Syrians, Lebanese, Persians, Ethiopians, people from the Caribbean, Chinese, Filipinx, and so much more. That diversity has always been one of our greatest strengths. You've heard of Sutter's Mill, where gold was first discovered? It's in the town of Coloma, which was almost entirely owned by a family of formerly enslaved Black people. You can still see the son's smithy and several other historic family buildings if you go there, which I recommend that you do! The whole town is basically a California history field trip.\nCalifornia has always opened her arms to the world, and it's made us stronger, better, wealthier, and more beautiful.\nWe have nothing but love to give the rest of the United States. Well, that and our significant tax contributions (we pay more to the federal government than we get back), ports, industry, films, and music. Oh, and we produce the most food of any state.

Interns from the Climate Change Communication Internship program, a partnership between 4C and the National Park Service, have created a Climate Change Communication Guide to help NPS employees engage visitors in climate change conversations and inspire them to support actions in parks and take actions at home. This guide aims to better prepare park staff to meet the needs of visitors, create more meaningful connections between visitors and parks, and sustain productive dialogues.
